## ADR-0001: Ducted vs Open Props for Tilt Pods (RKV-M-TQ)

**Status**: Accepted • **Date**: 2025-09-25 • **Owner**: J

### Context

Tilt-quad pods must supply high static thrust, survive debris/strikes, control
acoustic signature, and tolerate frequent tilt transitions. Outer duct = **0.60
m**; tip clearance target **≥ 10 mm**; pod centers x = 0.50/1.20 m, ±y = 0.795
m.

### Options Considered

1. **Ducted + Single** rotor
2. **Ducted + Coax (3+3)**
3. **Open + Single** rotor
4. **Open + Coax**

### Decision

Adopt **Ducted + Single** as the **baseline** tilt pod. Keep **Ducted + Coax**
as a **mission kit** (TQ-XR) for hot/high or heavy payload cases. Open props are
reserved for the **QP tail pusher** variant only.

### Rationale

- **Survivability & Safety**: Duct protects tips and bystanders; best debris
  tolerance
- **Static Thrust & Control**: Ducted single has **higher FoM** at hover;
  smoother transitions than coax; simpler mixer/faults
- **Acoustics**: Duct enables **lower tip speed** for equal thrust; reduced
  tones vs open/coax
- **Mass/Complexity**: Ducted single is lowest for protected pods
- **Mission Flexibility**: Coax kit available for extreme conditions

### Implementation

- **Baseline Configuration**: 4x ducted single-rotor tilt pods
- **Mission Kit**: TQ-XR with ducted coax for high-altitude/heavy payload
  missions
- **Duct Design**: 0.60m outer diameter with 10mm+ tip clearance
- **Pod Positioning**: x = 0.50/1.20 m, ±y = 0.795 m

## ADR-0002: Single vs Coaxial Rotor for Tilt Pods

**Status**: Accepted • **Date**: 2025-09-26 • **Owner**: J

### Context

Decision between single and coaxial rotor configurations for the RKV-M tilt-quad
system, considering performance, complexity, and mission requirements.

### Options Considered

1. **Single Rotor**: One rotor per pod
2. **Coaxial Rotor**: Two counter-rotating rotors per pod

### Decision

**Single rotor** for baseline configuration, with **coaxial option** available
as mission kit for extreme conditions.

### Rationale

- **Performance**: Single rotor provides higher figure of merit (FoM) at hover
- **Complexity**: Single rotor reduces mechanical complexity and failure modes
- **Control**: Simpler control mixing and fault handling
- **Mass**: Lower mass for standard missions
- **Flexibility**: Coaxial available for high-altitude/heavy payload missions

### Implementation

- **Baseline**: Single rotor per tilt pod
- **Mission Kit**: Coaxial configuration (TQ-XR) for extreme conditions
- **Control System**: Simplified mixing for single rotor, advanced mixing for
  coaxial

## ADR-0003: Blade Count Selection

**Status**: Accepted • **Date**: 2025-09-27 • **Owner**: J

### Context

Selection of optimal blade count for the RKV-M tilt-quad system, balancing
performance, acoustics, and manufacturing considerations.

### Options Considered

1. **2-Blade**: Simple, lightweight
2. **3-Blade**: Balanced performance and complexity
3. **4-Blade**: High performance, increased complexity
4. **5+ Blade**: Maximum performance, high complexity

### Decision

**3-blade** configuration for baseline, with **4-blade** option for
high-performance missions.

### Rationale

- **Performance**: 3-blade provides optimal balance of thrust and efficiency
- **Acoustics**: Reduced blade passing frequency compared to 2-blade
- **Manufacturing**: Standard 3-blade manufacturing processes
- **Flexibility**: 4-blade option for high-performance missions
- **Maintenance**: Reasonable complexity for field maintenance

### Implementation

- **Baseline**: 3-blade rotors for all tilt pods
- **High-Performance**: 4-blade option for TQ-XR mission kit
- **Manufacturing**: Standard 3-blade tooling and processes

## ADR-0004: Powerplant Classes

**Status**: Accepted • **Date**: 2025-09-28 • **Owner**: J

### Context

Selection of powerplant classes for the RKV-M system, considering power
requirements, efficiency, and mission flexibility.

### Options Considered

1. **Electric**: Battery-powered electric motors
2. **Hybrid**: Electric with range-extending generator
3. **Turbine**: Small gas turbine engines
4. **Multi-Fuel**: Flexible fuel options

### Decision

**Electric** for baseline with **Hybrid** option for extended missions.

### Rationale

- **Efficiency**: Electric provides highest efficiency for short missions
- **Reliability**: Fewer moving parts, higher reliability
- **Maintenance**: Simplified maintenance requirements
- **Flexibility**: Hybrid option for extended range missions
- **Environmental**: Zero emissions for electric operation

### Implementation

- **Baseline**: High-performance electric motors with lithium-ion batteries

mission requirements and operational environments.

### Options Considered

1. **Single Variant**: One configuration for all missions
2. **Mission Kits**: Modular kits for different missions
3. **Multiple Variants**: Separate configurations for different missions
4. **Hybrid Approach**: Base system with mission-specific kits

### Decision

**Hybrid Approach**: Base RKV-M system with mission-specific kits and variants.

### Rationale

- **Flexibility**: Mission-specific optimization while maintaining commonality
- **Cost**: Shared base system reduces development and production costs
- **Logistics**: Common maintenance and training across variants
- **Performance**: Optimized performance for specific mission requirements
- **Scalability**: Easy to add new mission kits and variants
