# Phoenix Rooivalk Market Analysis

## Market Opportunity: Explosive Growth in Counter-Drone Systems

The C-UAS market presents exceptional opportunities, valued at **$2.45-3.0B in
2024** and projected to reach **$9-15B by 2030** at 23-27% CAGR. The Pentagon
Replicator program alone commits **$500M** to deploy thousands of autonomous
drones by August 2025, while recent contract awards total over **$6B** including
