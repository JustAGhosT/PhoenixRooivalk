# module-integration

The system implements a modular blockchain-based evidence anchoring architecture with the following key integration components:

### Blockchain Provider Integration Layer
- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/base_provider.py`
- **Importance Score:** 85
- Defines abstract provider interface for blockchain interactions
- Enables swappable implementations for different chains (Etherlink, Solana)
- Standardizes transaction submission and receipt verification flows

### Evidence Anchoring Pipeline
- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`, `backend/services/evidence_log.py`
- **Importance Score:** 90
- Coordinates evidence collection, hashing, and on-chain anchoring
- Implements dual-chain anchoring strategy (Etherlink + Solana) for redundancy
- Manages atomic commit patterns for evidence logs and blockchain submissions

### Outbox Integration Pattern
- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/outbox.py`, `backend/workers/outbox_worker.py`
- **Importance Score:** 85
- Provides reliable blockchain operation delivery with retry semantics
- Coordinates state transitions between evidence logging and chain anchoring
- Implements at-least-once delivery guarantees for mission-critical events

### Network-Specific Adapters
- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/etherlink_provider.py`, `backend/services/solana_anchor.py`
- **Importance Score:** 80
- Network-specific implementations of the provider interface
- Handles chain-specific address formats and validation rules
- Manages network-specific retry strategies and error handling

### Configuration Integration
- **Path:** `backend/config/database.py`, `backend/server_modules/database.py`
- **Importance Score:** 75
- Provides dynamic module loading based on deployment configuration
- Coordinates database connections across service components
- Manages environment-specific blockchain endpoint configurations
