# module-integration
The system implements a modular blockchain-based evidence anchoring architecture with the following key integration components:
### Blockchain Provider Integration Layer
- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/base_provider.py`
- **Importance Score:** 85
- Defines abstract provider interface for blockchain interactions
- Enables swappable implementations for different chains (Etherlink, Solana)
- Standardizes transaction submission and receipt verification flows
### Evidence Anchoring Pipeline
- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`, `backend/services/evidence_log.py`
- **Importance Score:** 90
- Coordinates evidence collection, hashing, and on-chain anchoring
- Implements dual-chain anchoring strategy (Etherlink + Solana) for redundancy
- Manages atomic commit patterns for evidence logs and blockchain submissions
### Outbox Integration Pattern
- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/outbox.py`, `backend/workers/outbox_worker.py`
- **Importance Score:** 85
- Provides reliable blockchain operation delivery with retry semantics
- Coordinates state transitions between evidence logging and chain anchoring
- Implements at-least-once delivery guarantees for mission-critical events
### Network-Specific Adapters
- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/etherlink_provider.py`, `backend/services/solana_anchor.py`
- **Importance Score:** 80
- Network-specific implementations of the provider interface
- Handles chain-specific address formats and validation rules
- Manages network-specific retry strategies and error handling
### Configuration Integration
- **Path:** `backend/config/database.py`, `backend/server_modules/database.py`
- **Importance Score:** 75
- Provides dynamic module loading based on deployment configuration
- Coordinates database connections across service components
- Manages environment-specific blockchain endpoint configurations

# module-integration

The project implements a modular integration architecture across several key components:

## Core Service Integration
Path: `apps/keeper/src/lib.rs`

Integration Components:
- Military evidence service connector 
- Cross-chain anchoring coordinator
- Threat response system integration
- Counter-UAS defense coordinator

Importance Score: 95/100

## Blockchain Evidence Anchoring Integration
Paths:
- `crates/anchor-etherlink/src/lib.rs`
- `crates/anchor-solana/src/lib.rs`

Integration Points:
- Cross-chain evidence propagation
- Military engagement record synchronization
- Chain-specific adapter interfaces
- Dual-chain failover coordination

Importance Score: 85/100

## Threat Response System
Path: `apps/marketing/src/components/ThreatSimulator/index.tsx`

Integration Components:
- Countermeasure system integration
- Threat classification subsystem
- Response coordination interface
- Multi-sensor data fusion

Importance Score: 80/100

## Evidence CLI Integration
Path: `apps/evidence-cli/src/main.rs`

Integration Points:
- Command-line interface for evidence recording
- Military engagement data collection
- Cross-service communication channels
- Blockchain submission coordination

Importance Score: 75/100

The modular architecture enables independent deployment of components while maintaining secure communication channels between military defense subsystems. Each module exposes standardized interfaces for threat response coordination and evidence recording.
