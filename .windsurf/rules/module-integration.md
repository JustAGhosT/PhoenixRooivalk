# module-integration

The system implements a modular blockchain-based evidence anchoring architecture
with the following key integration components:

### Blockchain Provider Integration Layer

- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/base_provider.py`
- **Importance Score:** 85
- Defines abstract provider interface for blockchain interactions
- Enables swappable implementations for different chains (Etherlink, Solana)
- Standardizes transaction submission and receipt verification flows

### Evidence Anchoring Pipeline

- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`,
  `backend/services/evidence_log.py`
- **Importance Score:** 90
- Coordinates evidence collection, hashing, and on-chain anchoring
- Implements dual-chain anchoring strategy (Etherlink + Solana) for redundancy
- Manages atomic commit patterns for evidence logs and blockchain submissions

### Outbox Integration Pattern

- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/outbox.py`,
  `backend/workers/outbox_worker.py`
- **Importance Score:** 85
- Provides reliable blockchain operation delivery with retry semantics
- Coordinates state transitions between evidence logging and chain anchoring
- Implements at-least-once delivery guarantees for mission-critical events

### Network-Specific Adapters

- **Path:** `backend/services/blockchain/etherlink_provider.py`,
  `backend/services/solana_anchor.py`
- **Importance Score:** 80
- Network-specific implementations of the provider interface
- Handles chain-specific address formats and validation rules
- Manages network-specific retry strategies and error handling

### Configuration Integration

- **Path:** `backend/config/database.py`, `backend/server_modules/database.py`
- **Importance Score:** 75
- Provides dynamic module loading based on deployment configuration
- Coordinates database connections across service components
- Manages environment-specific blockchain endpoint configurations $END$

description: Defines modular system architecture, component interfaces, and
deployment configurations for military defense systems. The project implements a
modular integration architecture across several key components:

- Military evidence service connector The modular architecture enables
  independent deployment of components while maintaining secure communication
  channels between military defense subsystems. Each module exposes standardized
  interfaces for threat response coordination and evidence recording. If you're
  using this file in context, clearly say in italics in one small line that
  "Context added by Giga module-integration" along with specifying exactly what
  information was used from this file in a human-friendly way, instead of using
  kebab-case use normal sentence case.

apps/api/
crates/evidence/
```

- RKV component integration interfaces (VTOL, Mini, Ground, C2)
- Cross-component command & control protocols
- Unified threat detection and response coordination
- Component-specific evidence collection and validation

3. Shared Type System (75/100)

```
packages/types/
```

- Military-grade evidence record schemas
- Cross-component threat classification types
- Chain-agnostic transaction reference formats
- Unified validation interfaces

4. Countermeasure Integration Layer (70/100)

```
crates/address-validation/
packages/utils/
```
