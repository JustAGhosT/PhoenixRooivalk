### Core Integration Components

#### Blockchain Handler Integration Hub
**File**: `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`
**Importance Score**: 85

Central integration hub that coordinates between different blockchain providers and services:
- Orchestrates transaction submission across multiple chains
- Manages provider failover and retry logic
- Coordinates evidence logging with on-chain anchoring
- Handles outbox processing for failed operations

#### Multi-Chain Address Management 
**File**: `backend/api/blockchain/networks.py`
**File**: `backend/api/blockchain/evm_address.py`
**Importance Score**: 75

Unified address handling across different blockchain networks:
- Network-specific address format validation
- Cross-chain address normalization
- EIP-55 checksum enforcement for EVM chains
- Metadata-driven network configuration

#### Evidence Logging Pipeline
**File**: `backend/services/evidence_log.py`
**File**: `backend/services/solana_anchor.py`
**Importance Score**: 80

Integrated evidence recording and anchoring system:
- Append-only event logging with integrity validation
- Automated digest calculation and verification
- Direct anchoring to Solana via Memo program
- Integration with outbox system for retry handling

#### Worker Integration
**File**: `backend/workers/outbox_worker.py`
**Importance Score**: 70

Background task coordination for blockchain operations:
- Scheduled outbox processing 
- Provider-agnostic batch handling
- Configuration-driven scheduling
- Error classification and recovery

### Integration Patterns

1. Provider Abstraction
- Common interface for multiple blockchain providers
- Network-specific implementation isolation
- Unified error handling and retry logic

2. Event Pipeline
- Standardized event logging format
- Automated digest calculation
- Configurable blockchain anchoring
- Failure recovery via outbox pattern

3. Address Management
- Network-aware address validation
- Cross-chain format normalization
- Metadata-driven configuration
- Reusable validation components
