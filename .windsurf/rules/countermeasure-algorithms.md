# countermeasure-algorithms

## Core RF Jamming Logic

- Implements military-grade frequency hopping patterns for jamming effectiveness
- Dynamic power allocation based on threat proximity and signal strength
- Smart band selection to minimize collateral interference
- Integrated via `RFJammingService` interface (external secured module)

**Importance Score:** 95

## GPS Spoofing Mechanisms

- Generates synthetic GPS signals to confuse hostile drone navigation
- Gradually drifts target coordinates to force controlled landings
- Validates spoofing effectiveness through realtime position monitoring
- Integrated via `GPSSpoofingService` interface (external secured module)

**Importance Score:** 90

## Signal Disruption Coordination

- Orchestrates multi-modal signal disruption across RF, GPS, and control channels
- Automatic escalation of countermeasures based on threat response
- Coordinates timing between different disruption mechanisms
- Integrated via `SignalDisruptionOrchestrator` interface (external secured module)

**Importance Score:** 85

## Engagement Protocols

- Risk-weighted decision trees for countermeasure selection
- Compliance validation against Rules of Engagement (ROE)
- After-action reporting and effectiveness analysis
- Integrated via `EngagementProtocolService` interface (external secured module)

**Importance Score:** 90

## Safe Shutdown Sequences

- Graceful deactivation of active countermeasures
- Validation of signal restoration in affected spectrum
- Confirmation of threat neutralization before standdown
- Integrated via `SafeShutdownService` interface (external secured module)

**Importance Score:** 80
