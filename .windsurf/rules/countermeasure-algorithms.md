# countermeasure-algorithms

Based on the provided specification, there is minimal direct implementation
information about the RF jamming and signal disruption algorithms. However, the
available structure indicates the following key components:

### Modular Counter-UAS Effectors (Importance Score: 95)

Implements a layered defense system that selectively activates countermeasures
based on threat assessment:

- Cost-optimized effector selection
- RF jamming coordination
- Resilient C2 links during electronic warfare conditions

### Operating Mode Controllers (Importance Score: 85)

Controls countermeasure behavior across different deployment scenarios:

- Mobile picket mode jamming patterns
- Site-fixed overwatch signal disruption
- Fiber-engage mode coordination
- Logistics mode RF emissions control

### Safety Controls & Compliance (Importance Score: 90)

Implements critical safety features for countermeasure deployment:

- Geofencing restrictions for jamming operations
- Fail-safe mechanisms for signal disruption
- Export control compliance checks
- Automated evidence logging of countermeasure activation Key implementation
  paths:
- `backend/services/evidence_log.py`: Records countermeasure activations
- `backend/workers/outbox_worker.py`: Coordinates countermeasure scheduling
- `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`: Verifies and logs countermeasure

## Core Countermeasure Components

Importance Score: 95

### Threat Response Algorithms

```typescript
threatTypes: {
  drone: { weakness: "kinetic", jamming: "rf" },
  radar: { weakness: "electronic", jamming: "sweep" },
  stealth: { weakness: "laser", jamming: "directed" },
  swarm: { weakness: "kinetic", jamming: "broad_spectrum" },
  heavy: { weakness: "laser", jamming: "targeted" }
}
```

### Signal Disruption Mechanisms

1. RF Jamming

- Targeted frequency band disruption
- Dynamic frequency hopping countermeasures
- Adaptive power scaling based on threat distance

2. GPS Spoofing

- Location data manipulation
- False coordinate injection
- Navigation system confusion tactics

3. Electronic Warfare Integration

- Multi-band signal interference
- Coordinated jamming patterns
- Selective frequency targeting

## Evidence Recording System

Importance Score: 85

```rust
pub trait CountermeasureEvidence {
    async fn record_engagement(&self, threat_type: ThreatType,
                             countermeasure: CountermeasureType) -> Result<EngagementRecord>;
    async fn verify_effectiveness(&self, record: &EngagementRecord) -> EffectivenessScore;
}
```

### Countermeasure Types

1. Active Jamming

- Broad spectrum interference
- Focused beam disruption
- Pulse jamming sequences

2. Passive Countermeasures

- Signal absorption
- Reflection techniques
- Electromagnetic masking
