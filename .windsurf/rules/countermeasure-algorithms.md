# countermeasure-algorithms

Based on the provided specification, there is minimal direct implementation
information about the RF jamming and signal disruption algorithms. However, the
available structure indicates the following key components:

### Modular Counter-UAS Effectors (Importance Score: 95)

Implements a layered defense system that selectively activates countermeasures
based on threat assessment:

- Cost-optimized effector selection
- RF jamming coordination
- Resilient C2 links during electronic warfare conditions

### Operating Mode Controllers (Importance Score: 85)

Controls countermeasure behavior across different deployment scenarios:

- Mobile picket mode jamming patterns
- Site-fixed overwatch signal disruption
- Fiber-engage mode coordination
- Logistics mode RF emissions control

### Safety Controls & Compliance (Importance Score: 90)

Implements critical safety features for countermeasure deployment:

- Geofencing restrictions for jamming operations
- Fail-safe mechanisms for signal disruption
- Export control compliance checks
- Automated evidence logging of countermeasure activation Key implementation
  paths:
- `backend/services/evidence_log.py`: Records countermeasure activations
- `backend/workers/outbox_worker.py`: Coordinates countermeasure scheduling
- `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`: Verifies and logs countermeasure
