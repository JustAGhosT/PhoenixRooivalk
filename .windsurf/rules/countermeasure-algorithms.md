# countermeasure-algorithms

Based on the provided specification, there is minimal direct documentation of countermeasure algorithms. However, the available information indicates the following structure:

### Non-Kinetic Countermeasure Framework

**File Path**: `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`
**Importance Score**: 85

The baseline non-kinetic countermeasure system integrates with the blockchain event logging to record engagement activities:

- Event recording for countermeasure activations
- Audit trails of RF jamming attempts
- Validation of countermeasure authorizations
- Logging of engagement outcomes

### Resilient Communications Layer

**File Path**: `backend/services/evidence_log.py`  
**Importance Score**: 80

Core communication disruption mechanisms include:

- Optical/RF link management for jam-resistant operations
- Fiber-based control channels during active countermeasures
- Spoof-resistant command and control protocols

### Engagement Modes  

**File Path**: `backend/api/blockchain/networks.py`
**Importance Score**: 75

The system supports multiple countermeasure engagement patterns:

- Mobile picket mode for advance threat detection
- Site-fixed overwatch with elevated optical mast
- Fiber-engage mode for jam-resistant control
- Layered defense activation sequence
