# detection-systems

Based on the provided specification, there appears to be no direct implementation details about drone detection systems in the codebase. However, the specification does reveal some high-level architectural elements related to detection capabilities:

### Event Logging System
**Importance Score: 75**
`backend/services/evidence_log.py`
- Implements append-only logging for detection events
- Records JSON Lines with timestamps and event types
- Stores SHA-256 digests for event correlation
- Ensures data integrity for detection audit trail

### Detection Data Flow
**Importance Score: 80**
`backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`
- Handles detection event processing and validation
- Integrates with various data providers
- Implements retry logic for failed detection events
- Manages outbox batches for reliable event processing

### Blockchain Event Anchoring
**Importance Score: 70**
`backend/services/solana_anchor.py`
- Anchors detection event digests to Solana blockchain
- Uses Memo program for immutable event recording
- Implements exponential backoff for network resilience
- Provides verification of detection timestamps

### Failed Event Processing
**Importance Score: 65**
`backend/workers/outbox_worker.py`
- Processes failed detection events
- Implements configurable retry schedules
- Handles transient and permanent failures
- Maintains detection event integrity
