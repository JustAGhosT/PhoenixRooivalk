Based on the provided specification, limited direct information exists about detection system components. However, the following high-level elements can be identified:
## System Integration Points
### Evidence Logging System (Importance Score: 85)
- Location: `backend/services/evidence_log.py`
- Records mission events and detection data in append-only format
- Computes SHA-256 digests of detection events
- Implements thread-safe logging with file locking for concurrent detection streams
### Detection Data Verification (Importance Score: 80)
- Location: `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`
- Anchors detection event digests to blockchain for tamper-proof verification
- Integrates with multiple chains (Etherlink, Solana) for redundant verification
- Implements retry mechanisms for reliable detection data storage
## Operating Modes
### Mobile Picket Mode (Importance Score: 90)
- Provides mobile detection capabilities
- Supports dynamic threat analysis during movement
- Maintains detection capabilities in EW-contested environments
### Site-Fixed Overwatch (Importance Score: 85)
- Permanent installation detection configuration
- Continuous monitoring and threat assessment
- Integration with fixed sensor arrays
### Fiber-Engage Mode (Importance Score: 80)
- Hardened detection capabilities via fiber connectivity
- Resistant to RF interference and jamming
- Enhanced detection range through distributed sensors

## Threat Detection Components

The threat detection system consists of:

1. Swarm Detection Engine
Path: `apps/marketing/src/components/ThreatSimulator/hooks/useThreatSpawner.ts`
- Processes incoming drone swarm formations
- Classifies threat patterns based on spatial distribution
- Maps threat movement vectors for trajectory prediction
- Assigns threat priority levels based on formation analysis

Importance Score: 85/100

2. Multi-Sensor Integration
Path: `apps/marketing/src/components/ThreatSimulator/hooks/useThreatGame.ts`
- Correlates data from simulated radar and optical sensors
- Determines threat classification confidence levels
- Implements sensor fusion for target validation
- Tracks multiple simultaneous threats across detection zones

Importance Score: 92/100

3. Threat Classification Matrix
Path: `apps/marketing/src/components/ThreatSimulator/types.ts`
- Defines threat categories based on:
  - Speed profiles
  - Flight patterns
  - Formation complexity
  - Payload signatures
- Maps detection confidence thresholds
- Specifies sensor type effectiveness per threat class

Importance Score: 88/100

4. Detection Zone Management
Path: `apps/marketing/src/hooks/useGameLogic.ts`
- Manages multiple overlapping detection zones
- Implements early warning thresholds
- Handles detection zone handoffs between sectors
- Processes detection confidence scoring

Importance Score: 82/100

5. Real-time Threat Assessment
Path: `apps/marketing/src/components/ThreatSimulator/StatusDisplay.tsx`
- Processes live threat detection data
- Updates threat classification status
- Manages detection confidence metrics
- Triggers escalation protocols based on threat levels

Importance Score: 78/100
