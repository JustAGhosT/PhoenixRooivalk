Based on the provided specification, limited direct information exists about
detection system components. However, the following high-level elements can be
identified:

## System Integration Points

### Evidence Logging System (Importance Score: 85)

- Location: `backend/services/evidence_log.py`
- Records mission events and detection data in append-only format
- Computes SHA-256 digests of detection events
- Implements thread-safe logging with file locking for concurrent detection
  streams

### Detection Data Verification (Importance Score: 80)

- Location: `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`
- Anchors detection event digests to blockchain for tamper-proof verification
- Integrates with multiple chains (Etherlink, Solana) for redundant verification
- Implements retry mechanisms for reliable detection data storage

## Operating Modes

### Mobile Picket Mode (Importance Score: 90)

- Provides mobile detection capabilities
- Supports dynamic threat analysis during movement
- Maintains detection capabilities in EW-contested environments

### Site-Fixed Overwatch (Importance Score: 85)

- Permanent installation detection configuration
- Continuous monitoring and threat assessment
- Integration with fixed sensor arrays

### Fiber-Engage Mode (Importance Score: 80)

- Hardened detection capabilities via fiber connectivity
- Resistant to RF interference and jamming
- Enhanced detection range through distributed sensors $END$
