# detection-systems

Based on the provided specification, limited direct information exists about
detection system components. However, the following high-level elements can be
identified:

## System Integration Points

### Evidence Logging System (Importance Score: 85)

- Location: `backend/services/evidence_log.py`
- Records mission events and detection data in append-only format
- Computes SHA-256 digests of detection events
- Implements thread-safe logging with file locking for concurrent detection
  streams

### Detection Data Verification (Importance Score: 80)

- Location: `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py`
- Anchors detection event digests to blockchain for tamper-proof verification
- Integrates with multiple chains (Etherlink, Solana) for redundant verification
- Implements retry mechanisms for reliable detection data storage

## Operating Modes

### Mobile Picket Mode (Importance Score: 90)

- Provides mobile detection capabilities
- Supports dynamic threat analysis during movement
- Maintains detection capabilities in EW-contested environments

### Site-Fixed Overwatch (Importance Score: 85)

- Permanent installation detection configuration
- Continuous monitoring and threat assessment
- Integration with fixed sensor arrays

### Fiber-Engage Mode (Importance Score: 80)

- Hardened detection capabilities via fiber connectivity
- Resistant to RF interference and jamming
- Enhanced detection range through distributed sensors $END$

## Threat Detection Core

Importance Score: 95

The system implements a multi-layered threat detection architecture with specialized modules for different types of aerial threats:

```typescript
threatTypes: {
  drone: { speed: 0.3, points: 100, weakness: "kinetic" },
  radar: { speed: 0.2, points: 150, weakness: "electronic" },
  stealth: { speed: 0.4, points: 200, weakness: "laser" },
  swarm: { speed: 0.5, points: 75, weakness: "kinetic" }
}
```

Key Components:
- RKV-M aerial VTOL mothership for primary threat detection
- RKV-I deployable mini units for distributed sensor coverage
- AI-powered classification with 99.7% accuracy
- Sub-200ms threat response time

## Evidence Recording System

Importance Score: 85

Implements cryptographic proof of engagement through a multi-chain anchoring system:

1. Evidence Generation
- Real-time threat encounter logging
- Cryptographic signatures for each detection event
- Geospatial metadata embedding

2. Chain Integration
```rust
pub trait AnchorProvider {
    async fn anchor(&self, evidence: &EvidenceRecord) -> Result<ChainTxRef>;
    async fn confirm(&self, tx: &ChainTxRef) -> Result<ChainTxRef>;
}
```

## Detection Data Flow

Importance Score: 80

1. Sensor Integration Layer
- Distributed sensor network management
- Real-time data fusion from multiple RKV units
- Automated calibration and sensor health monitoring

2. Threat Analysis Pipeline
- Machine learning-based threat classification
- Behavioral pattern recognition
- Swarm detection algorithms

## Core Files:
- `apps/keeper/src/lib.rs`: Evidence management system
- `crates/evidence/src/lib.rs`: Core detection record handling
- `apps/api/src/main.rs`: Detection system API endpoints
