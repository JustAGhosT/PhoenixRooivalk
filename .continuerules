## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The PhoenixRooivalk counter-drone defense system consists of four major business components:

1. Autonomous Defense Core (95)
- Multi-layered threat detection using RF, acoustic and optical signatures
- Real-time response system with 120-195ms engagement time
- Edge-based decision making for GPS-denied environments
- Autonomous drone swarm coordination protocols
- Military-grade rules of engagement enforcement

2. Evidence Management System (90)
- Dual-chain (Solana + EtherLink) evidence anchoring
- Cryptographic proof generation for threat engagements
- Tamper-proof audit trail for military accountability
- Chain-agnostic transaction verification
- Evidence job lifecycle management

3. Tactical Resource Management (85)
- Dynamic energy budgeting across weapon systems
- Formation control for defensive drone swarms
- Specialized drone type coordination (interceptor, jammer, shield)
- Mission-specific deployment zone generation
- Progressive research and technology unlock system

4. Threat Response Engine (80)
- Zone-based threat prioritization algorithms
- Multi-factor effectiveness calculation
- Resource-aware deployment decisions
- Formation-specific behavior patterns
- Threat wave generation and progression

The system implements a modular architecture allowing flexible deployment scaling based on threat levels. Core components communicate through an event-driven system ensuring sub-200ms response times in contested environments.

Military compliance features include geofencing, fail-safe RTL protocols, and mandatory civilian protection zones. All engagements are recorded with blockchain-based evidence anchoring for accountability.
