# Main Overview - Simulation/Gameplay System
**This document describes a simulation/threat-model for testing and gameplay purposes only. The PhoenixRooivalk is a counter-drone defense system simulator, not an actual military platform.**

The PhoenixRooivalk counter-drone defense system simulator consists of four major business components for gameplay balance and simulation priority.

## Simulation Components
- Multi-layered threat detection using simulated RF, acoustic and optical signatures
- Simulated response system with representative 120-195ms engagement time
- Edge-based decision making for simulated GPS-denied environments
- Simulated drone swarm coordination protocols
- Representative rules of engagement for gameplay purposes
- Simulated dual-chain (Solana + EtherLink) evidence anchoring
- Cryptographic proof generation for simulated threat engagements
- Representative audit trail for accountability in gameplay scenarios
- Chain-agnostic transaction verification simulation
- Evidence job lifecycle management for gameplay and demonstration
- Simulated energy budgeting across weapon systems
- Formation control for simulated defensive drone swarms
- Specialized drone type coordination in gameplay scenarios
- Mission-specific deployment zone generation for simulation purposes
- Progressive research and technology unlock system for player progression
- Zone-based threat prioritization algorithms for gameplay balance
- Multi-factor effectiveness calculation in simulated environments
- Resource-aware deployment decisions for gameplay strategy
- Formation-specific behavior patterns for enhanced simulation
- Threat wave generation and progression for gameplay challenge
## Simulation Architecture & Performance

The simulator implements a modular architecture allowing flexible deployment scaling based on simulated threat levels. Core components communicate through an event-driven system targeting sub-200ms response times in simulated contested environments.

## Simulated Safety & Compliance

Simulated compliance features include geofencing, fail-safe return-to-launch (RTL) protocols, and mandatory civilian protection zones. All simulated engagements are recorded with blockchain-based evidence anchoring for gameplay accountability and mission debriefing.

## Verification & Performance Notes

**Simulation Context:** All performance metrics, response times, and system capabilities described in this document are simulated values designed for gameplay balance and entertainment purposes only.

**Verification Expectations:** 
- Performance claims represent simulated targets within the game environment
- Response times and system capabilities are not validated hardware benchmarks
- Reviewers should evaluate features based on gameplay experience and simulation fidelity
- No real-world defense system capabilities are implied or represented

## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
