# === USER INSTRUCTIONS ===
# main-overview
## Development Guidelines
- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.
The system architecture combines blockchain-based evidence logging with counter-UAS defense capabilities:
## Core Blockchain Operations
The blockchain integration layer handles mission-critical event anchoring and transaction management:
### Evidence Anchoring System (Importance: 90)
- Evidence logging with SHA-256 digest computation
- Multi-chain anchoring across Solana and EtherLink networks
- Append-only logging with atomic file operations
- Transaction outbox pattern for reliable blockchain submissions
Key components:
```
backend/services/
├── blockchain_handler.py    # High-level blockchain operations
├── evidence_log.py         # Secure event logging
├── solana_anchor.py        # Solana chain integration
└── blockchain/
    └── outbox.py          # Reliable transaction handling
```
## Counter-UAS System Components
### Defense Layer Management (Importance: 95)
- Modular defense system with layered effector activation
- Cost-optimization logic for effector selection
- Resilient command and control in EW environments
- Multiple operating modes:
  - Mobile picket deployment
  - Site-fixed overwatch
  - Fiber-engage capabilities
  - Logistics support
### Access Control System (Importance: 85)
- Partner vetting workflow
- Export control compliance checks
- Geofencing restrictions
- Operational safeguards
### Financial Operations (Importance: 80)
- Cost-effective effector management
- Break-even analysis integration
- Profit margin optimization
- Scalability metrics tracking

The system implements a military-grade Counter-UAS defense platform with blockchain-based evidence anchoring. Core functionality is organized into three primary domains:
## Counter-UAS Defense Simulation
Primary implementation in ThreatSimulator components orchestrates:
- Threat classification and response modeling
- Countermeasure effectiveness matrices
- Dynamic difficulty scaling
- Swarm attack pattern generation
- Multi-level progression systems
Score: 90/100
## Blockchain Evidence Anchoring
Located in evidence and anchor crates:
- Military engagement proof generation
- Cross-chain transaction verification
- Chain-specific address validation
- Dual-chain failover mechanisms
- Cryptographic evidence records
Score: 85/100
## Automated Threat Response
Implemented across threat spawning and game logic components:
- Coordinated swarm attack generation
- Battlefield positioning algorithms
- Countermeasure cooldown systems
- Threat-countermeasure relationship mapping
- Auto-trigger capability management
Score: 82/100
The system integrates these domains through a unified architecture where threat detection feeds into both simulation and evidence anchoring subsystems, while blockchain components provide immutable engagement records.
Key interconnections:
- Threat detection triggers evidence anchoring
- Countermeasure effectiveness data feeds blockchain records
- Cross-chain validation ensures military-grade reliability
- Address validation secures all blockchain interactions

## Blockchain Evidence System (Importance: 90)
Located in `crates/anchor-etherlink` and `crates/anchor-solana`
- Dual-chain evidence anchoring
- Military-grade cryptographic proof generation
- Tamper-proof audit trails
- Federated learning integration
- Autonomous swarm coordination protocols

## Threat Response Engine (Importance: 85)
Located in `apps/keeper`

  ```
  drone: kinetic countermeasures
  radar: electronic warfare
  stealth: laser-based detection
  swarm: distributed response
  heavy: laser neutralization
  ```
