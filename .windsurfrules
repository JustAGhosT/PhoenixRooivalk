## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The system architecture combines blockchain-based evidence logging with counter-UAS defense capabilities:

## Core Blockchain Operations
The blockchain integration layer handles mission-critical event anchoring and transaction management:

### Evidence Anchoring System (Importance: 90)
- Evidence logging with SHA-256 digest computation
- Multi-chain anchoring across Solana and EtherLink networks
- Append-only logging with atomic file operations
- Transaction outbox pattern for reliable blockchain submissions

Key components:
```
backend/services/
├── blockchain_handler.py    # High-level blockchain operations
├── evidence_log.py         # Secure event logging
├── solana_anchor.py        # Solana chain integration
└── blockchain/
    └── outbox.py          # Reliable transaction handling
```

## Counter-UAS System Components

### Defense Layer Management (Importance: 95)
- Modular defense system with layered effector activation
- Cost-optimization logic for effector selection
- Resilient command and control in EW environments
- Multiple operating modes:
  - Mobile picket deployment
  - Site-fixed overwatch
  - Fiber-engage capabilities
  - Logistics support

### Access Control System (Importance: 85)
- Partner vetting workflow
- Export control compliance checks
- Geofencing restrictions
- Operational safeguards

### Financial Operations (Importance: 80)
- Cost-effective effector management
- Break-even analysis integration
- Profit margin optimization
- Scalability metrics tracking
