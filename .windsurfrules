## Development Guidelines

- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.


The project implements a multi-chain blockchain integration system with several key components:

## Core Blockchain Components

### Address Management and Validation
Located in `backend/api/blockchain/evm_address.py` and `backend/api/blockchain/networks.py`, these modules handle:
- EVM address validation with EIP-55 checksum enforcement
- Cross-chain address format standardization
- Network-specific metadata and validation rules
Importance Score: 65

### Transaction Handling and Evidence
The `backend/services/blockchain_handler.py` serves as the central orchestrator:
- Manages blockchain operations across multiple providers
- Implements fault-tolerant transaction submission
- Coordinates with the outbox system for failed operations
Importance Score: 80

### Evidence Logging System
Implemented in `backend/services/evidence_log.py`:
- Append-only logging of mission events
- SHA-256 digest generation for blockchain anchoring
- JSON Lines format with canonical payload representation
Importance Score: 75

### Chain-Specific Implementations

#### Solana Integration
`backend/services/solana_anchor.py` provides:
- On-chain anchoring using Memo program
- SHA-256 digest submission
- Retry logic with exponential backoff
Importance Score: 75

#### Outbox Processing
`backend/workers/outbox_worker.py` implements:
- Periodic processing of failed blockchain operations
- Configurable retry schedules
- Error classification and handling
Importance Score: 70

The system is designed for cross-chain compatibility, with dedicated handlers for EVM-compatible chains (Ethereum, EtherLink) and Solana. The evidence logging system acts as a central source of truth, with blockchain anchoring providing immutable verification of mission events.
