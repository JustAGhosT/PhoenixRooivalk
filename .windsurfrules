## Development Guidelines
- Only modify code directly relevant to the specific request. Avoid changing unrelated functionality.
- Never replace code with placeholders like `# ... rest of the processing ...`. Always include complete code.
- Break problems into smaller steps. Think through each step separately before implementing.
- Always provide a complete PLAN with REASONING based on evidence from code and logs before making changes.
- Explain your OBSERVATIONS clearly, then provide REASONING to identify the exact issue. Add console logs when needed to gather more information.

- Swarm attack pattern generation
- Multi-level progression systems
Score: 90/100
## Blockchain Evidence Anchoring
Located in evidence and anchor crates:
- Military engagement proof generation
- Cross-chain transaction verification
- Chain-specific address validation
- Dual-chain failover mechanisms
- Cryptographic evidence records
Score: 85/100
## Automated Threat Response
Implemented across threat spawning and game logic components:
- Coordinated swarm attack generation
- Battlefield positioning algorithms
- Countermeasure cooldown systems
- Threat-countermeasure relationship mapping
- Auto-trigger capability management
Score: 82/100
The system integrates these domains through a unified architecture where threat detection feeds into both simulation and evidence anchoring subsystems, while blockchain components provide immutable engagement records.
Key interconnections:
- Threat detection triggers evidence anchoring
- Countermeasure effectiveness data feeds blockchain records
- Cross-chain validation ensures military-grade reliability
- Address validation secures all blockchain interactions
