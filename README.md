## üöÅ **PhoenixRooivalk Counter-Drone Defense Platform**

PhoenixRooivalk is a next-generation modular counter-Unmanned Aircraft System (c-UAS) defense platform that operates autonomously even when communications are completely jammed. Our system delivers military-grade drone threat detection and neutralization in 120-195ms response times - 25-40x faster than traditional systems that fail when enemies jam communications.

**Key Features:**
‚Ä¢ **Edge Autonomy**: Level-0 autonomous operation without network dependency
‚Ä¢ **Modular Architecture**: VTOL motherships, interceptors, and ground support systems  
‚Ä¢ **Blockchain Evidence**: Tamper-proof dual-chain (Solana + EtherLink) audit trails
‚Ä¢ **Real-time Processing**: Multi-sensor fusion with 95%+ AI detection accuracy
‚Ä¢ **EW Resilience**: GPS-denied and jamming-resistant operation

**Technology Stack:**
‚Ä¢ Rust-based blockchain evidence management
‚Ä¢ Solana and EtherLink dual-chain anchoring
‚Ä¢ NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin (275 TOPS AI performance)
‚Ä¢ Real-time threat simulation and response systems
‚Ä¢ Military-grade sensor fusion algorithms

Our platform addresses the critical gap in defense systems that fail when communications are compromised, providing reliable protection for critical infrastructure, military installations, and civilian areas against increasingly sophisticated drone threats.

**Corporate Status**: Nexamesh Technologies (Delaware C-Corp in progress)

cargo clippy                           # Run Rust linter
cargo test                             # Run Rust tests
```

### Deployment

Deployments are performed by GitHub Actions to two separate Netlify sites:

- **Docs**: `.github/workflows/deploy-docs-site.yml` publishes `apps/docs/build/`
  - Secrets: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_DOCS_SITE_ID`
  - Triggers: Push to `main` branch, changes to `apps/docs/**`
- **Marketing**: `.github/workflows/deploy-marketing-site.yml` publishes `apps/marketing/out/`
  - Secrets: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_MARKETING_SITE_ID`
  - Triggers: Push to `main` branch, changes to `apps/marketing/**`

Additional workflows:
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/ci-marketing.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci-rust.yml`
- **Security**: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` for vulnerability scanning

Netlify's "Deploys from Git" is disabled; Actions upload artifacts directly.

### Cross‚Äësite links (env)

- Docs site can link back to marketing via `MARKETING_URL` (build‚Äëtime env for
  `apps/docs`).
- Marketing site can link to docs via `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` (public runtime env
  for `apps/marketing`).

Set these in each Netlify site‚Äôs Environment variables if you want absolute
cross‚Äëlinks.

### Redirects

- Marketing site publishes `public/_redirects` to forward common paths to the
  docs site. Update the hostnames there to match your actual docs domain if it
  changes.

> defense partners. Redistribution or public disclosure is prohibited. See

## Overview

PhoenixRooivalk delivers a layered, modular counter‚ÄëUAS capability for contested
EM environments. The public materials in this repository provide a high‚Äëlevel
overview and governance. Partner‚Äëonly details (specifications, simulations,
integration guides) are shared upon approval.

## Mission

Provide a modular, layered defense against low‚Äëcost UAS threats by cueing the
cheapest effective effector first, preserving high‚Äëvalue effectors, and
maintaining C2 in heavy EW through resilient optical and RF links.

## System overview (abstract)

- RKV‚ÄëM: Aerial VTOL mothership for picket, relay, and mini launch; resilient
  comms and survivability provisions.
- RKV‚ÄëI: Deployable minis (interceptor, decoy, ISR). Control via RF or optional
  fiber for jam‚Äëresistant teleoperation. Non‚Äëkinetic baseline.
- RKV‚ÄëG: Ground support rover acting as mobile GCS, mast, and logistics node;
  can bear fiber spools for engagements.
- RKV‚ÄëC2: Command, control, and data plane with strict QoS, eventing, and
  observability; weapon‚Äëagnostic integration patterns.

For detailed specifications and planning baselines, see [`index.md`](./index.md)
(restricted).

## Operating modes

- Mobile picket: Extend detection/relay ahead of maneuver elements.
- Site‚Äëfixed overwatch: Short micro‚Äëtether or elevated optical mast.
- Fiber‚Äëengage: Rover establishes fiber link for spoof‚Äëresistant control.
- Logistics: Resupply, magazine swap, and net deployment support.

## Operational tasks

### Evidence management (CLI)

- Rust CLI: `cargo run --bin evidence-cli -- <command>`
- Examples:

```powershell
# Record evidence
cargo run --bin evidence-cli -- record engagement_summary '{"missionId":"M-123","result":"success"}'

# Process anchoring jobs
cargo run --bin keeper -- --interval 5 --batch-limit 25
```

For runbook-style metrics capture, use the Operations Log template:

- [Operations log template ‚Äî anchoring runs](./docs/operations/monitoring/Operations_Log_Template.md)

## Access request (partners)

Approved defense partners may request access to extended documentation and
artifacts. Please see [`ACCESS.md`](./ACCESS.md) for intake details and required
information.

## Responsible use

This project is weapon‚Äëagnostic by design. Integration of restricted payloads
occurs only under applicable law and export controls. See
[`RESPONSIBLE_USE.md`](./RESPONSIBLE_USE.md).

## Site preview

Both sites are automatically deployed to Netlify via GitHub Actions:

- **Marketing Site**: Built with Next.js 14 and deployed from `apps/marketing/out/`
- **Documentation Site**: Built with Docusaurus and deployed from `apps/docs/build/`

You can view the live sites at the configured Netlify domains (see [Live Sites](#-live-sites) section above).
