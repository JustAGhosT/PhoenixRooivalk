### Development commands

Run from the repository root:

```bash
# enable pnpm via corepack
corepack enable

# install workspace dependencies
pnpm install

# develop marketing (Next.js) - http://localhost:3000
pnpm --filter marketing dev

# develop docs (Docusaurus) - http://localhost:3000
pnpm --filter docs start

# build all
pnpm build

# build single app (static export)
pnpm --filter marketing build  # outputs to apps/marketing/out/
pnpm --filter docs build       # outputs to apps/docs/build/

# run Rust API locally
cargo run --manifest-path apps/api/Cargo.toml

# run Rust services
cargo run --manifest-path apps/keeper/Cargo.toml    # Blockchain keeper
cargo run --manifest-path apps/evidence-cli/Cargo.toml -- <command>  # Evidence CLI

# run utility scripts
./scripts/deploy.sh                    # Deployment script
./scripts/Invoke-Tests.ps1            # PowerShell test runner
./scripts/Invoke-OutboxWorker.ps1     # Blockchain outbox worker

# linting and formatting
pnpm lint                              # Run ESLint on all packages
pnpm typecheck                         # TypeScript type checking
pnpm format                            # Format code with Prettier
pnpm format:check                      # Check formatting without fixing

# Rust development
cargo check                            # Check Rust code without building
cargo clippy                           # Run Rust linter
cargo test                             # Run Rust tests
```

### Deployment

Deployments are performed by GitHub Actions to two separate Netlify sites:

- **Docs**: `.github/workflows/deploy-docs-site.yml` publishes `apps/docs/build/`
  - Secrets: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_DOCS_SITE_ID`
  - Triggers: Push to `main` branch, changes to `apps/docs/**`
- **Marketing**: `.github/workflows/deploy-marketing-site.yml` publishes `apps/marketing/out/`
  - Secrets: `NETLIFY_AUTH_TOKEN`, `NETLIFY_MARKETING_SITE_ID`
  - Triggers: Push to `main` branch, changes to `apps/marketing/**`

Additional workflows:
- **CI/CD**: `.github/workflows/ci-marketing.yml`, `.github/workflows/ci-rust.yml`
- **Security**: `.github/workflows/codeql.yml` for vulnerability scanning

Netlify's "Deploys from Git" is disabled; Actions upload artifacts directly.

### Cross‚Äësite links (env)

- Docs site can link back to marketing via `MARKETING_URL` (build‚Äëtime env for
  `apps/docs`).
- Marketing site can link to docs via `NEXT_PUBLIC_DOCS_URL` (public runtime env
  for `apps/marketing`).

Set these in each Netlify site‚Äôs Environment variables if you want absolute
cross‚Äëlinks.

### Redirects

- Marketing site publishes `public/_redirects` to forward common paths to the
  docs site. Update the hostnames there to match your actual docs domain if it
  changes.

## Overview

PhoenixRooivalk delivers a layered, modular counter‚ÄëUAS capability for contested
EM environments. The public materials in this repository provide a high‚Äëlevel
overview and governance. Partner‚Äëonly details (specifications, simulations,
integration guides) are shared upon approval.

## Mission

Provide a modular, layered defense against low‚Äëcost UAS threats by cueing the
cheapest effective effector first, preserving high‚Äëvalue effectors, and
maintaining C2 in heavy EW through resilient optical and RF links.

## System overview (abstract)

- RKV‚ÄëM: Aerial VTOL mothership for picket, relay, and mini launch; resilient
  comms and survivability provisions.
- RKV‚ÄëI: Deployable minis (interceptor, decoy, ISR). Control via RF or optional
  fiber for jam‚Äëresistant teleoperation. Non‚Äëkinetic baseline.
- RKV‚ÄëG: Ground support rover acting as mobile GCS, mast, and logistics node;
  can bear fiber spools for engagements.
- RKV‚ÄëC2: Command, control, and data plane with strict QoS, eventing, and
  observability; weapon‚Äëagnostic integration patterns.

For detailed specifications and planning baselines, see [`index.md`](./index.md)
(restricted).

## Operating modes

- Mobile picket: Extend detection/relay ahead of maneuver elements.
- Site‚Äëfixed overwatch: Short micro‚Äëtether or elevated optical mast.
- Fiber‚Äëengage: Rover establishes fiber link for spoof‚Äëresistant control.
- Logistics: Resupply, magazine swap, and net deployment support.

## Operational tasks

### Evidence management (CLI)

- Rust CLI: `cargo run --bin evidence-cli -- <command>`
- Examples:

```powershell
# Record evidence
cargo run --bin evidence-cli -- record engagement_summary '{"missionId":"M-123","result":"success"}'

# Process anchoring jobs
cargo run --bin keeper -- --interval 5 --batch-limit 25
```

For runbook-style metrics capture, use the Operations Log template:

- [Operations log template ‚Äî anchoring runs](./docs/operations/monitoring/Operations_Log_Template.md)

## Access request (partners)

Approved defense partners may request access to extended documentation and
artifacts. Please see [`ACCESS.md`](./ACCESS.md) for intake details and required
information.

## Responsible use

This project is weapon‚Äëagnostic by design. Integration of restricted payloads
occurs only under applicable law and export controls. See
[`RESPONSIBLE_USE.md`](./RESPONSIBLE_USE.md).

## Site preview

Both sites are automatically deployed to Netlify via GitHub Actions:

- **Marketing Site**: Built with Next.js 14 and deployed from `apps/marketing/out/`
- **Documentation Site**: Built with Docusaurus and deployed from `apps/docs/build/`

You can view the live sites at the configured Netlify domains (see [Live Sites](#-live-sites) section above).
