## Mission

Provide a modular, layered defense against low‑cost UAS threats by cueing the
cheapest effective effector first and maintaining C2 in heavy EW via resilient
FSO and RF links.

## System overview (abstract)

- RKV‑M: Aerial VTOL mothership for picket, relay, and mini launch.
- RKV‑I: Minis (interceptor, decoy, ISR); RF control or optional fiber.
- RKV‑G: Rover as mobile GCS, mast, logistics; can bear fiber spools.
- RKV‑C2: C2/data plane with strict QoS, eventing, and observability.

## Operating modes

- Mobile picket
- Site‑fixed overwatch (short micro‑tether or elevated mast)
- Fiber‑engage
- Logistics support
