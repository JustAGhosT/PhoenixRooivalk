# module-integration

The system implements a modular counter-drone defense architecture with these key integration components:

## Core System Integration (Score: 95)
Located in `apps/api/src/lib.rs`:
- Autonomous defense module coordinator 
- Cross-module message bus for real-time threat data
- Pluggable sensor interface supporting RF, optical, and acoustic inputs
- Dynamic countermeasure selection and deployment

## Evidence Chain Integration (Score: 90)
Located in `crates/evidence/src/lib.rs`:
- Multi-chain evidence anchoring system
- Pluggable blockchain adapters for Solana and EtherLink
- Standardized evidence packaging format
- Cross-module cryptographic verification

## Deployment Configuration (Score: 85)
Located in `apps/keeper/src/lib.rs`:
- Zone-based deployment configuration
- Resource allocation optimization
- Formation management interfaces
- Mission-specific deployment profiles

## Sensor Fusion Integration (Score: 80)
Located in `packages/types/src/index.ts`:
- Unified sensor data model
- Multi-modal threat detection interface
- Standardized confidence scoring
- Cross-sensor correlation engine

## Countermeasure Coordination (Score: 75)
Located in `apps/api/src/handlers.rs`:
- Standardized countermeasure interface
- Real-time effectiveness scoring
