### Core Integration Architecture

The modular system consists of four main integration layers:

1. Threat Detection Layer
- Integrates multiple sensor inputs via `autoTargeting.ts` and `threatUtils.ts`
- Routes sensor data through `eventSystem.ts` for real-time threat assessment
- Configurable detection thresholds per deployment environment

2. Response Orchestration Layer 
- Manages countermeasure deployment via `formationManager.ts` and `strategicDeployment.ts`
- Coordinates resource allocation through `resourceManager.ts`
- Handles dynamic formation adjustments based on threat analysis

3. Evidence Management Layer
- Anchors evidence records to multiple blockchains via `anchor-etherlink` and `anchor-solana` crates
- Implements tamper-proof audit trails through `evidence` crate
- Manages evidence job queues and processing via keeper service

4. Edge Computing Layer
- Enables offline operation through `gameEngine.ts` autonomous processing
- Implements SAE Level 4 autonomy via `simpleStateMachine.ts` and `performanceMonitor.ts`
- Handles resource constraints through `objectPool.ts` optimization

### Integration Patterns

1. Event-Driven Communication
- `eventSystem.ts` provides pub/sub backbone for inter-module communication
- `waveManager.ts` coordinates staged threat progressions
- `responseProtocols.ts` handles asynchronous countermeasure coordination

2. Resource Management
- Pooled resource allocation via `objectPool.ts`
- Dynamic power budgeting through `resourceManager.ts`
- Formation-based resource optimization in `formationUtils.ts`

3. State Management
- Hierarchical state machine via `simpleStateMachine.ts`
- Threat state tracking in `threatTypes.ts`
- Weapon system states managed by `weaponTypes.ts`

### Deployment Configurations

Custom deployment profiles defined in `strategicDeployment.ts`:
- Airport Security (restricted ROE)
- Military Base (full capabilities)
- VIP Protection (minimal footprint)
- Urban Environment (collateral prevention)

Each profile configures:
- Sensor fusion parameters
- Response protocol thresholds
- Resource allocation priorities
- Formation patterns
- Evidence anchoring requirements
