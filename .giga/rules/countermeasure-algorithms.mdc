# countermeasure-algorithms

## RF Jamming System
Importance Score: 95

Core business logic in `apps/marketing/src/components/utils/responseProtocols.ts`:
- Dynamic frequency hopping across common drone control bands (2.4GHz, 5.8GHz)
- Intelligent power output modulation based on target distance and signal strength
- Pattern recognition for drone control protocols (DJI OcuSync, FrSky, etc)
- Selective jamming to avoid interference with friendly systems
- Automatic failsafe trigger detection for different drone models

## GPS Spoofing Engine
Importance Score: 90

Implementation in `apps/marketing/src/components/utils/threatUtils.ts`:
- Gradual GPS drift calculation to avoid drone failsafe detection
- Multi-constellation spoofing (GPS, GLONASS, Galileo)
- Dynamic altitude manipulation algorithms
- Return-to-home location modification
- Geofence compliance verification during spoofing operations

## Signal Disruption Coordination
Importance Score: 85

Core logic in `apps/marketing/src/components/utils/strategicDeployment.ts`:
- Multi-modal signal analysis for protocol identification
- Coordinated jamming patterns across multiple defensive units
- Automatic power adjustment based on civilian RF activity
- Signal strength triangulation for optimal jammer positioning
- Reactive frequency scanning for agile threat response

## Countermeasure Selection System
Importance Score: 80

Implementation details:
- Threat classification based on RF signatures
- Environmental impact assessment for different countermeasures
- Real-time effectiveness monitoring and adaptation
- Automatic failover between different countermeasure types
- Legal compliance verification for restricted RF bands
