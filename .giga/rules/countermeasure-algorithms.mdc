# countermeasure-algorithms

## RF Jamming System
Importance Score: 95

**Architecture Requirements:**
- Must be implemented within `internal-libs/rf-countermeasures` or `secure-backend-services/jamming-service`
- No implementation details permitted in public application code
- Accessible only through `CountermeasureAPI` with appropriate authentication
- Interface: `IRFCountermeasureProvider` for standardized access
**Capability Reference:**
- RF signal analysis and countermeasure selection capabilities
- Frequency management with regulatory compliance controls
- Protocol-aware signal processing
- Interference avoidance for authorized systems
- Manufacturer-specific response strategies

> **SECURITY NOTE:** Implementation details for RF jamming algorithms are classified. Contact the security team for access to specifications and implementation guidelines.
## GPS Spoofing Engine
Importance Score: 90

**Architecture Requirements:**
- Must be implemented within `internal-libs/positioning-security` or `secure-backend-services/navigation-protection`
- Frontend may only display status indicators, not implementation logic
- Access restricted through `SecurePositioningService` with proper authorization
- Interface: `IPositioningCountermeasureService` for standard integration
**Capability Reference:**
- Navigation signal management capabilities
- Multi-system coordination framework
- Position management algorithms
- Secure navigation controls
- Compliance verification system

> **SECURITY NOTE:** GPS spoofing implementation details require security clearance. Consult security team before any related development.

## Signal Disruption Coordination
Importance Score: 85

**Architecture Requirements:**
- Must be implemented in `internal-libs/signal-security` or `secure-backend-services/spectrum-protection`
- Accessible only through authenticated service endpoints
- Frontend restricted to status visualization only
- Interface: `ISignalDisruptionController` for standardized integration

**Capability Reference:**
- Multi-band signal analysis framework
- Coordinated response orchestration
- Environmental awareness systems
- Position optimization logic
- Adaptive response capabilities

> **SECURITY NOTE:** Signal disruption algorithms are restricted. Reference secure development protocols and consult security team for implementation requirements.

## Countermeasure Selection System
Importance Score: 80

**Architecture Requirements:**
- Must be implemented in `internal-libs/threat-response` or `secure-backend-services/countermeasure-orchestration`
- Public code may only reference abstract concepts via secure interfaces
- Access controlled through `ThreatResponseService` with proper authorization
- Interface: `ICountermeasureSelector` for integration

**Capability Reference:**
- Threat classification system
- Environmental impact assessment
- Effectiveness monitoring framework
- Countermeasure coordination
- Regulatory compliance verification

> **SECURITY NOTE:** All countermeasure implementation details must remain in secure, access-controlled modules. Contact the security team for implementation guidelines and classification review requirements.
