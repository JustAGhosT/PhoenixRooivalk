# Phoenix Rooivalk Manufacturing Strategy

## Executive Summary

Phoenix Rooivalk's manufacturing strategy leverages a dual entity approach:
Delaware C-Corp for US/ITAR markets and South African entity for global non-ITAR
markets. The hybrid production model balances in-house manufacturing for IP
protection with strategic sourcing for cost optimization and supply chain
resilience.
