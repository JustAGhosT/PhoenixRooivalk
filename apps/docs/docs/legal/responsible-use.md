# Responsible Use (Public-safe)

This page summarizes the public-safe responsible use stance for the project.
For the full repo policy, see:

- [RESPONSIBLE_USE.md](https://github.com/JustAGhosT/PhoenixRooivalk/blob/main/RESPONSIBLE_USE.md)
- [ACCESS.md](https://github.com/JustAGhosT/PhoenixRooivalk/blob/main/ACCESS.md)

## Principles

- Weapon-agnostic public documentation: no operational/kinetic details.
- Defensive, lawful counterâ€‘UAS focus only.
- No secrets in repo; use proper key management.
- Auditability and safety are mandatory.

## Engagement constraints

- Follow applicable law, export controls, and sanctions.
- Obtain required regulator authorizations for any RF/GNSS emissions testing.
- Use shielded labs or certified ranges where applicable.
- Maintain geofences, fail-safe RTL, do-not-engage cones, and audit logs.

## AI usage

- Do not instruct AI systems to generate operational jamming/spoofing content.
- Any AI-assisted content in these areas requires prior security/legal review.
