### 1.2 Risk Assessment Methodology

**Risk Scoring Formula**: Risk Score = Probability × Business Impact × Impact
Multiplier

**Impact Multipliers**:

- **Critical**: 1.0 (Business failure potential)
- **High**: 0.8 (Major operational disruption)
- **Medium**: 0.6 (Moderate service impact)
- **Low**: 0.4 (Minor operational issues)

**Risk Appetite Thresholds**:

- **Critical Risks**: 5% tolerance (immediate action required)
- **High Risks**: 15% tolerance (priority mitigation)
- **Medium Risks**: 30% tolerance (planned mitigation)
- **Low Risks**: 50% tolerance (monitor and review)
