### Blockchain Infrastructure

- **Hyperledger Fabric**: Multi-peer network with orderer consensus
- **Certificate Authority**: PKI infrastructure with automated rotation
- **State Database**: CouchDB with replication and backup
- **Channel Management**: Multi-channel configuration and governance

## Deployment Automation

### GitOps Workflow

```yaml
gitops_pipeline:
  source_control: "Git repository with infrastructure as code"
  ci_pipeline: "Automated build, test, and security scanning"
  cd_pipeline: "Automated deployment with validation"
  monitoring: "Continuous monitoring and alerting"

  deployment_stages:
    1_build: "Code compilation and artifact creation"
    2_test: "Automated testing and quality gates"
    3_security: "Security scanning and compliance validation"
    4_deploy: "Infrastructure provisioning and application deployment"
    5_validate: "Health checks and performance validation"
```

### Infrastructure as Code

- **Terraform**: Cloud infrastructure provisioning and management
- **Helm Charts**: Kubernetes application packaging and deployment
- **Ansible**: Configuration management and automation
- **GitOps**: Declarative infrastructure and application management

## Security & Compliance

### Security Controls

- **Network Security**: VPC isolation, security groups, and NACLs
- **Data Encryption**: Encryption at rest and in transit
- **Access Control**: IAM roles, RBAC, and service accounts
- **Secrets Management**: AWS Secrets Manager and Kubernetes secrets

### Compliance Framework

- **NIST Cybersecurity Framework**: Complete implementation
- **FedRAMP**: Federal cloud security requirements
- **STIG**: Security Technical Implementation Guides
- **SOC 2**: Service organization controls compliance

## Monitoring & Observability

### Monitoring Stack

- **Metrics**: Prometheus for metrics collection and storage
- **Visualization**: Grafana dashboards and alerting
- **Logging**: ELK stack for centralized log management
- **Tracing**: Jaeger for distributed request tracing

### Key Performance Indicators

- **System Availability**: 99.9% uptime target
- **Response Time**: <1 second API response time
- **Throughput**: 3,500+ transactions per second
- **Error Rate**: <0.1% application error rate

## Disaster Recovery

### Business Continuity

- **Recovery Time Objective (RTO)**: <5 minutes
- **Recovery Point Objective (RPO)**: <1 minute
- **Geographic Redundancy**: Multi-region deployment
- **Automated Failover**: Health-based traffic routing

### Backup Strategy

- **Database Backups**: Automated daily backups with point-in-time recovery
- **Configuration Backups**: Infrastructure and application configuration
- **Blockchain Backups**: Ledger data replication and archival
- **Disaster Recovery Testing**: Regular DR drills and validation

## Performance Optimization

### Scalability Design

- **Horizontal Scaling**: Auto-scaling based on demand
- **Vertical Scaling**: Resource optimization and right-sizing
- **Load Balancing**: Traffic distribution and health checking
- **Caching**: Redis for application and session caching

### Cost Optimization

- **Resource Right-Sizing**: Continuous resource optimization
- **Reserved Instances**: Cost reduction through commitment pricing
- **Spot Instances**: Cost-effective compute for non-critical workloads
- **Storage Optimization**: Lifecycle policies and compression

## Operational Procedures

### Deployment Procedures

- **Pre-Deployment**: Validation checklist and approval process
- **Deployment Execution**: Automated deployment with monitoring
- **Post-Deployment**: Validation testing and performance monitoring
- **Rollback Procedures**: Automated rollback on failure detection

### Maintenance Procedures
