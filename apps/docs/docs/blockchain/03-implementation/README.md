## Development Setup

### Prerequisites
- Node.js 18+
- Docker and Docker Compose
- Kubernetes cluster (for production)
- Access to blockchain networks

### Local Development
```bash
# Clone repository
git clone <repository-url>
cd phoenix-rooivalk

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Start development environment
docker-compose up -d

# Run tests
npm test

# Build for production
npm run build
```

### Environment Configuration
- Development: Local blockchain networks
- Staging: Testnet environments
- Production: Mainnet with monitoring

## Architecture Overview

The implementation follows a microservices architecture with the following key components:

- **Authentication Service**: Handles user authentication and authorization
- **Blockchain Service**: Manages blockchain interactions
- **Data Service**: Handles data processing and storage
- **AI Service**: Provides machine learning capabilities
- **API Gateway**: Routes requests to appropriate services

## Security Considerations

- All communications encrypted with TLS 1.3
- Multi-factor authentication required
- Regular security audits and penetration testing
- Compliance with military security standards

## Performance Requirements

- Response time: < 100ms for API calls
- Throughput: 1000+ requests per second
- Availability: 99.9% uptime
- Scalability: Auto-scaling based on load

## Monitoring and Observability

- Comprehensive logging with structured logs
- Metrics collection and alerting
- Distributed tracing for request flows
- Health checks and status endpoints

## Testing Strategy

- Unit tests for all components
- Integration tests for service interactions
- End-to-end tests for critical workflows
- Performance tests for load validation
- Security tests for vulnerability assessment

## Deployment

### Container Deployment
```bash
# Build container image
docker build -t phoenix-rooivalk .

# Run container
docker run -p 3000:3000 phoenix-rooivalk
```

### Kubernetes Deployment
```bash
# Apply Kubernetes manifests
kubectl apply -f k8s/

# Verify deployment
kubectl get pods
kubectl get services
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
- Database connection failures
- Blockchain network connectivity
- Authentication token expiration
- Memory and CPU usage spikes

### Debug Mode
Enable debug logging by setting `DEBUG=true` environment variable.

### Support
For technical support, contact the development team or refer to the operations playbook.
