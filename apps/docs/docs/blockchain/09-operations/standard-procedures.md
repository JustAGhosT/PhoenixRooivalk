# daily-security-check.sh

echo "=== Daily Security Compliance Check ==="

# Verify network policies
kubectl get networkpolicies -A | grep -q "phoenix-rooivalk" || echo "FAIL: Network policies missing"

# Check pod security policies
kubectl get podsecuritypolicies | grep -q "restricted" || echo "FAIL: Pod security policies not enforced"

# Validate TLS certificates
kubectl get secrets -n phoenix-rooivalk | grep tls | while read secret; do
  kubectl get secret "$secret" -o jsonpath='{.data.tls\.crt}' | base64 -d | openssl x509 -noout -dates
done

# Audit log verification
kubectl logs -n kube-system $(kubectl get pods -n kube-system -l component=kube-apiserver -o name) | grep audit | tail -10
```

### 3.2 Access Control Verification

**Weekly Access Review:**

1. Review all user accounts and permissions
2. Validate role-based access controls (RBAC)
3. Check for unused or expired accounts
4. Verify multi-factor authentication compliance
