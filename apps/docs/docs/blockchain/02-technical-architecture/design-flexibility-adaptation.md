# Design Flexibility & Adaptation

## Overview

The Phoenix Rooivalk system architecture is designed with modularity and
adaptability as core principles, enabling the technology to evolve and adapt to
different operational environments, threat scenarios, and market requirements.
This document outlines the flexible design patterns and adaptation mechanisms
built into the system.

## Modular Architecture Principles

### 1. Sensor Integration Points

The system employs a plugin-based sensor architecture that allows for:

- **Multi-modal Detection**: Integration of radar, optical, acoustic, and RF
  sensors
- **Vendor Agnostic Design**: Standardized interfaces for different sensor
  manufacturers
- **Hot-swappable Components**: Runtime sensor replacement and configuration
- **Scalable Detection Networks**: Distributed sensor arrays with centralized
  coordination

```

### 2. Configurable Decision Algorithms

The autonomous decision-making system supports multiple algorithm
configurations:

- **Rule-based Systems**: Deterministic logic for well-defined scenarios
- **Machine Learning Models**: Adaptive algorithms for complex threat patterns
- **Hybrid Approaches**: Combination of rule-based and ML for robust
  decision-making
- **A/B Testing Framework**: Runtime algorithm switching for performance
  comparison

### 3. Adaptable Countermeasure Selection

The countermeasure system provides flexible response options:

- **Soft-kill First**: Non-destructive countermeasures (jamming, spoofing)
- **Escalation Protocols**: Progressive response based on threat assessment
- **Environmental Adaptation**: Countermeasures tailored to operational
  constraints
- **Legal Compliance**: Configurable response limits based on jurisdiction
