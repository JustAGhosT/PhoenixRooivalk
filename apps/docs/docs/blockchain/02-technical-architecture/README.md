# Technical Architecture

This section covers the technical architecture of the Phoenix Rooivalk blockchain integration system.

## Overview

The technical architecture is designed to provide:

- **High Performance**: Sub-second response times for critical operations
- **Security**: Military-grade encryption and authentication
- **Scalability**: Support for large-scale deployments
- **Reliability**: Fault-tolerant design with redundancy

## Key Components

### Blockchain Protocols
- [Level-0 Architecture](blockchain-protocols/level-0-architecture.md)
- [Solana POC](blockchain-protocols/solana-poc.md)
- [Protocol Comparison](blockchain-protocols/protocol-comparison.md)
- [Hyperledger Fabric](blockchain-protocols/hyperledger-fabric.md)
- [Polkadot Integration](blockchain-protocols/polkadot-integration.md)

### System Architecture

- [Hybrid Architecture](hybrid-architecture.md)
- [Performance Metrics](performance-metrics.md)
- [System Requirements](system-requirements.md)

## Design Principles

1. **Modularity**: Components are designed to be independently deployable
2. **Security**: Defense-in-depth approach with multiple security layers
3. **Performance**: Optimized for real-time operations
4. **Maintainability**: Clear separation of concerns and documentation

## Implementation Phases

The architecture is implemented in phases:

1. **Phase 1**: Core blockchain integration
2. **Phase 2**: Advanced features and optimizations
3. **Phase 3**: Production deployment and monitoring
