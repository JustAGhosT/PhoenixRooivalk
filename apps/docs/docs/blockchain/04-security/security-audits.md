code audits, penetration testing, formal verification, and compliance
validation. Our multi-layered audit approach includes automated security
scanning, third-party security assessments, continuous monitoring, and formal
mathematical proofs of critical security properties, ensuring military-grade
security assurance.

**Key Innovation**: We deploy Continuous Security Validation (CSV) that combines
traditional audit methodologies with blockchain-specific security analysis,
automated vulnerability detection, and real-time security monitoring to maintain
ongoing security assurance throughout the system lifecycle.
