# Security Framework

This section covers the comprehensive security framework for the Phoenix Rooivalk blockchain integration system.

## Overview

The security framework is designed to meet military-grade security requirements and protect against advanced persistent threats.

## Security Components

### Threat Model
- [Threat Model](threat-model.md) - Comprehensive analysis of potential threats
- Attack surface analysis
- Risk assessment and mitigation strategies

### Security Audits
- [Security Audits](security-audits.md) - Regular security assessments
- Penetration testing procedures
- Vulnerability management process

### Byzantine Fault Tolerance
- [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](byzantine-fault-tolerance.md) - Consensus mechanisms
- Fault tolerance strategies
- Network resilience design

### Quantum Resistance
- [Quantum Resistance](quantum-resistance.md) - Post-quantum cryptography
- Future-proof security measures
- Migration strategies

## Security Principles

### Defense in Depth
Multiple layers of security controls:
1. **Network Security**: Firewalls, VPNs, network segmentation
2. **Application Security**: Input validation, secure coding practices
3. **Data Security**: Encryption at rest and in transit
4. **Identity Security**: Multi-factor authentication, role-based access
5. **Operational Security**: Monitoring, incident response

### Zero Trust Architecture
- Never trust, always verify
- Continuous authentication and authorization
- Least privilege access principles
- Micro-segmentation

### Security by Design
- Security integrated from the beginning
- Regular security reviews and testing
- Automated security scanning
- Continuous security monitoring

## Cryptographic Standards

### Encryption
- **Symmetric**: AES-256-GCM for data encryption
- **Asymmetric**: RSA-4096, ECDSA P-384 for key exchange
- **Hash Functions**: SHA-3 for integrity verification

### Digital Signatures
- ECDSA for blockchain transactions
- EdDSA for high-performance scenarios
- Post-quantum signatures (future)

### Key Management
- Hardware Security Modules (HSM)
- Key rotation policies
- Secure key distribution
- Key escrow for recovery

## Authentication and Authorization

### Multi-Factor Authentication
- Primary: Username/password or biometric
- Secondary: TOTP, SMS, hardware tokens
- Tertiary: Location-based, device-based

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Fine-grained permissions
- Principle of least privilege
- Regular access reviews
- Privilege escalation controls

### Identity Management
- Single Sign-On (SSO) integration
- Active Directory/LDAP integration
- Certificate-based authentication
- Anonymous access for public data

## Data Protection

### Data Classification
- **Public**: No restrictions
- **Internal**: Limited to organization
- **Confidential**: Restricted to authorized personnel
- **Top Secret**: Highly restricted access

### Data Encryption
- **At Rest**: AES-256 encryption for stored data
- **In Transit**: TLS 1.3 for network communications
- **In Processing**: Secure enclaves for sensitive operations

### Data Loss Prevention (DLP)
- Content inspection and filtering
- Data exfiltration monitoring
- Automated response to violations
- Regular data audits

## Network Security

### Network Architecture
- Micro-segmentation
- Zero-trust network access
- Software-defined networking
- Network monitoring and analytics

### Firewall Configuration
- Next-generation firewalls
- Application-layer filtering
- Intrusion prevention systems
- Advanced threat protection

### VPN and Remote Access
- IPsec VPN for site-to-site
- SSL VPN for remote users
- Multi-factor authentication
- Session monitoring

## Incident Response

### Security Operations Center (SOC)
- 24/7 monitoring and response
- Threat intelligence integration
- Automated incident detection
- Escalation procedures

### Incident Response Plan
1. **Detection**: Automated and manual detection
2. **Analysis**: Threat assessment and impact analysis
3. **Containment**: Isolate affected systems
4. **Eradication**: Remove threats and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore normal operations
6. **Lessons Learned**: Post-incident review

### Forensics and Investigation
- Digital forensics capabilities
- Evidence preservation
- Chain of custody procedures
- Legal and compliance requirements

## Compliance and Governance

### Regulatory Compliance
- **ITAR**: International Traffic in Arms Regulations
- **EAR**: Export Administration Regulations
- **GDPR**: General Data Protection Regulation
- **SOX**: Sarbanes-Oxley Act
- **HIPAA**: Health Insurance Portability and Accountability Act

### Security Governance
- Security policies and procedures
- Regular security training
- Security awareness programs
- Risk management framework

### Audit and Assessment
- Regular security audits
- Compliance assessments
- Penetration testing
- Vulnerability scanning

## Security Monitoring

### Security Information and Event Management (SIEM)
- Centralized log collection
- Real-time event correlation
- Automated alerting
- Forensic analysis capabilities

### Threat Intelligence
- External threat feeds
- Internal threat analysis
- Machine learning for threat detection
- Automated response to threats

### Metrics and KPIs
- Mean Time to Detection (MTTD)
- Mean Time to Response (MTTR)
- Security incident frequency
- Vulnerability remediation time

## Training and Awareness

### Security Training
