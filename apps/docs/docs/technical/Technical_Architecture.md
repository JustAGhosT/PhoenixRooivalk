# Phoenix Rooivalk Technical Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

Phoenix Rooivalk implements a **Comms-Independent Edge Autonomy (CIEA)**
architecture that achieves sub-2ms authentication and 120–195ms end-to-end
decision latency through edge-first processing. The system combines AI-driven
threat detection with cryptographically anchored evidence trails to ensure both
rapid response and verifiable accountability in all conditions.

## Architectural Principles

- **Edge-First Processing**: All critical decisions made locally without network
  dependency
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Tolerates up to 1/3 compromised nodes in
  consensus operations
- **Modular Design**: Swappable components and vendor-agnostic interfaces
- **Blockchain Integration**: Immutable evidence anchoring for legal compliance

## Hardware Foundation

**NVIDIA Jetson AGX Orin / Orin NX**

- AI Throughput: Up to 275 TOPS (Tera Operations Per Second)
- GPU: NVIDIA Ampere architecture with 2048 CUDA Cores, 64 Tensor Cores
- CPU: 12-core Arm Cortex-A78AE v8.2 64-bit CPU
- Memory: 64GB 256-bit LPDDR5, 204.8 GB/s
- Storage: 64GB eMMC 5.1

## Software Stack

**Operating System**: RedHawk Linux RTOS (Real-Time Operating System)

- Real-Time Performance: Deterministic task scheduling, low latency
- Security: SELinux, secure boot, FIPS 140-2 compliant modules
- Reliability: High availability, fault tolerance

**ROS 2 (Robot Operating System 2)**

- Middleware: DDS (Data Distribution Service) for real-time communication
- Modularity: Component-based architecture for flexible development
- Scalability: Distributed system architecture for swarm coordination
- Security: SROS 2 for secure communication and access control
