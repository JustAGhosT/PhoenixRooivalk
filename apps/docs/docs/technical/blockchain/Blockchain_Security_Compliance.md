# Phoenix Rooivalk Blockchain Security and Compliance

## Executive Summary

Phoenix Rooivalk implements comprehensive post-quantum cryptography (PQC) to
protect against quantum computing threats that could compromise current
cryptographic systems. Our quantum-resistant architecture uses NIST-standardized
algorithms including CRYSTALS-Kyber for key encapsulation, CRYSTALS-Dilithium
for digital signatures, and SPHINCS+ for backup signatures, ensuring long-term
security against both classical and quantum attacks.

**Key Innovation**: We deploy Hybrid Quantum-Classical Cryptography (HQCC) that
combines traditional cryptographic algorithms with post-quantum alternatives,
providing security against current threats while preparing for the quantum era.
This approach ensures backward compatibility while delivering quantum
resistance.
