## Solana for Immutable Evidence Anchoring

Solana provides exceptional capabilities for evidence anchoring in counter-drone
operations with **3,000-4,500 real-world TPS**, **sub-2-second finality**, and
remarkably low costs at **$0.00025 per transaction**. For a high-frequency
logging scenario of one transaction per second continuously, annual costs would
be only $7,884 compared to orders of magnitude more on other blockchains.
