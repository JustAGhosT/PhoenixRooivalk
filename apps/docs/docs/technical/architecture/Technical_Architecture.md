# Phoenix Rooivalk Technical Architecture

## System Architecture Overview

Phoenix Rooivalk implements a **Comms-Independent Edge Autonomy (CIEA)**
architecture that achieves sub-2ms authentication and 50–195ms end-to-end
decision latency through edge-first processing. The system combines AI-driven
threat detection with cryptographically anchored evidence trails to ensure both
rapid response and verifiable accountability in all conditions.

### Architectural Principles

- **Edge-First Processing**: All critical decisions made locally without network
  dependency
- **Byzantine Fault Tolerance**: Tolerates up to 1/3 compromised nodes in
  consensus operations
- **Modular Design**: Swappable components and vendor-agnostic interfaces
- **Evidence Off-Path**: Audit recording doesn't impact real-time performance
- **Quantum-Resistant**: Crypto-agility for post-quantum security requirements
