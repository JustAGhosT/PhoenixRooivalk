## ADR 0001: Chain Selection for On-Chain Anchoring (Solana vs Others)

**Date**: 2025-09-24  
**Status**: Accepted (pilot on Solana)

### Context

We need a Layer 1 anchoring target for tamper-evident hashes of mission
evidence. Criteria include security, latency, cost, resilience,
interoperability, and operational fit for contested environments.

### Options Considered

- **Ethereum (L1)**: High security but high fees and slow finality
- **Solana (L1)**: High throughput with low latency and low fees
- **Avalanche (L1/Subnets)**: Good performance with subnet capabilities
- **Polkadot (Relay + Parachains)**: Interoperability focus with complex
  architecture
- **Bitcoin (L1)**: Highest security but slow and expensive

### Decision

Adopt Solana as the initial pilot chain for anchoring evidence digests.

### Rationale

- **Low-Latency Finality**: High throughput supports near-real-time anchoring
  for dynamic operations
- **Low Fees**: Enable frequent anchoring without prohibitive cost
- **Mature Memo Program**: Simple, contract-free anchoring path
- **Ecosystem Tooling**: Sufficient tooling for pilot implementation
  (solana-py/solders)
- **Performance**: 3,000-4,500 TPS with sub-2-second finality
- **Cost Efficiency**: $0.00025 per transaction

### Consequences

- **Resilience Monitoring**: Must monitor resilience during high network load
- **Retry/Backoff**: Add retry/backoff and outbox batching for reliability
- **Compliance Anchoring**: May implement periodic Ethereum anchoring for
  compliance/archival
- **Classified Deployments**: Subnet/private chain options (e.g., Avalanche) for
  classified deployments

### Implementation
