## Executive Summary

**The Challenge.** Modern sUAS are proliferating, RF-silent, and swarm-capable.
Centralized C2 architectures fail under EW. Most systems degrade to detect-only
when comms die.

Current systems suffer from critical limitations: 2-5 second
detection-to-neutralization latency, vulnerability to RF-silent drones
(affecting 64% of market), and inability to handle coordinated swarm attacks.

**The Phoenix Rooivalk Solution.** Phoenix Rooivalk implements
**Comms-Independent Edge Autonomy (CIEA)** that:

- Acts locally with autonomous soft-kill cueing under policy, achieving
  **120-195 ms p50 (≤250 ms p95)** end-to-end without network dependency
- Maintains accountability by recording hash-based evidence to a permissioned
  audit layer off the engagement path
- Coordinates opportunistically with coalition partners via seconds-class
  cross-organization messaging when links permit
- **Fault tolerance**: Where consensus is used, tolerates up to one-third faulty
  nodes (3f+1); Level-0 real-time loops do not rely on distributed consensus

**Key Technical Differentiators:**

- **10-40x Performance Improvement**: 120-195 ms p50 vs 2-5 seconds for current
  systems
- **RF-Silent Drone Detection**: Multi-sensor fusion handles autonomous threats
- **Level-0 Autonomous Operation**: Complete edge operation without
  communications
- **Blockchain Audit Trails**: Tamper-proof engagement records for legal
  compliance
- **Swarm Defense Capability**: Handles 50+ concurrent tracks with graceful
  degradation
- **Coalition-Ready**: NATO, Five Eyes, and designated partner nation
  interoperability

**Investment & Decision Points:**

- **Phase 1 (Concept)**: $3.5M → Architecture validation, simulation
- **Phase 2 (Prototype)**: $15M → Hardware demo, lab tests
- **Phase 3 (Integration)**: $25M → Field trials, certification readiness
- **Total to TRL7**: $43.5M over ~3 years

**Market Entry Strategy:** Following Anduril's proven path to $14B valuation
through Air Force SBIR Phase I ($350K), targeting CMMC 2.0 Level 2 certification
and partnerships with established defense contractors.

### Plain-Language Introduction: What Phoenix Rooivalk Does

**What Phoenix Rooivalk Does (Plain English):**

Phoenix Rooivalk is a defensive system that detects, classifies, and responds to
hostile small drones on its own when radios and backhaul are jammed. It makes
policy-bounded, "soft-kill first" decisions at the edge in 120-195 ms (p50) /
≤250 ms (p95) and records tamper-evident receipts after the fact for
accountability. When communications are available, it can optionally share
sanitized, need-to-know alerts with partners; real-time action never waits on
external networks. Humans remain in control for anything risky or lethal.

**Why This Is Different:**

- **Acts fast on its own**: It doesn't freeze if Wi-Fi or radios go down
- **Gentle first**: Tries non-destructive methods by default
- **Honest receipts**: Keeps tamper-proof records so people can trust what it
  did
- **Plays nice with others**: Can share safe, simple alerts with partners,
  without giving away private stuff
- **Safe rules**: Humans stay in charge of anything dangerous

**The Simple Flow:**

1. **Listen and look**: Sensors notice something in the sky
2. **Think fast**: Tiny computers decide if it's a drone and if it's a problem
3. **Follow the rules**: Check safety rules before doing anything
4. **Act gently**: Try a soft stop first (like confusing the drone)
5. **Write it down**: Record what happened for later review
6. **Tell friends (optional)**: If allowed, share a short alert with partners

- Policy gates: 10-30
- Effector cueing: 20-40

**End-to-End Performance:**

- **E2E p50**: 120-195 ms (soft-kill cueing)
- **E2E p95**: ≤250 ms (soft-kill cueing)
- **Micro-loop (on-node)**: sub-10 ms R&D target
- **Ledger off-path**: Audit batching asynchronous and off the real-time path
- **XCM seconds-class**: Never gates real-time actuation

**Design SLOs & Measurement Method:**

- **E2E soft-kill cueing**: p50 ∈ [120,195] ms; p95 ≤ 250 ms

- Emphasize "human-supervised" not "fully autonomous"
- Focus on defensive and protective applications
- Clear rules of engagement implementation
- Transparent decision-making algorithms
- **Kinetic effects are HITL by default. HOTL only where authorized; no lethal
  autonomy claims**

### 11.4 Operational Risk Management

**Deployment Controls:**

- Immutable artifacts with SBOMs and signatures
- Configuration-as-data with environment overlays
- Blue/green or canary deployment for C2 and services
- Access control for C2 endpoints with audit logging
- Secret management via platform vaults (no secrets in repo)

## 13. Coalition Interoperability & MOSA (Modular Open Systems Architecture)

### 13.1 Coalition-Ready Interoperability

**Standards-First Feeds:**

- **CoT/ATAK** for blue-force situational awareness (threat pins, geofences,
  tasking)
- **ASTERIX** track export (Cat 48/62) and **STANAG 4609** FMV metadata (EO/IR)
- **STANAG 4586** (UAS control), **4607** (GMTI tracks) - roadmap
- **Link-16/MADL** receive-only initially; participation subject to national
  approvals and certification

**Cross-Organization Coordination:**

- **Polkadot/XCM**: Seconds-class message finality; hub-and-spoke isolation;
  strict ACLs
- **On-site sharing**: 100-150 ms typical (sub-second capability)
- **Cross-organization**: Seconds-class finality; never used for real-time
  actuation
- **Sanitized tracks/status/ROE updates**: Coordination, not fire-control

### 13.2 Vendor Isolation & MOSA

**Hub-Mediated Trust:**

- No vendor-to-vendor dependencies
- Protocol adapters with schema validation (REST/gRPC/DDS)
- Sandbox certification prior to onboarding
- Per-tenant ACLs with bilateral authorization

**Data Minimization Profiles:**

- **AlertOnly** (default): Track ID + location/time
- **TrackLite**: + kinematics + coarse confidence
- **Track+Context**: + intent features + policy tags
- **EvidenceOnRequest**: bounded-time escrow via bilateral authorization
- Higher tiers require bilateral authorization and classification checks

### 13.3 Evidence Schema & Audit Trail

**Comprehensive Evidence Schema:**

- **event_id**: UUIDv7 with PTP/GPSDO synchronized timestamps
- **sensor_hashes**: per-modality SHA-256 for integrity verification
- **decision_context**: threat_class, PID_conf, intent_vector,
  uncertainty_bounds
- **policy_version**: ROE profile semver with signed attestation
- **effector_action**: type, parameters, authorization_token
- **operator_override**: HITL/HOTL decision tracking with rationale
- **environment**: weather_code, EW_profile_id, site_layout_id
- **chain_of_custody**: node_id, signer_id, timestamp, channel_id,
  privacy_collection_id

**Retention & Export:**

- Retention by classification with crypto rotation schedule
- Export workflow: request → ACL check → privacy-preserving bundle →
  cross-domain transfer logged on Fabric
- Reconstitution: deterministic replay from hashes + timestamps; gap audit with
  reason codes

## 14. Conclusion

Phoenix Rooivalk's Level-0 autonomous architecture addresses three critical
failures in current counter-drone systems: inadequate response speed,
vulnerability to RF-silent threats, and inability to handle coordinated attacks.

By achieving 120-195ms operational latency while maintaining blockchain-verified
accountability, Phoenix offers a genuine paradigm shift in counter-drone
capability.

**Market Opportunity:**

- $2.3-4.5B current market growing to $9-26B by 2030
- Current systems suffer from 2-5 second latency, RF-silent drone vulnerability,
  and swarm handling limitations
- Phoenix's 100x latency improvement positions for significant market share

**Success Factors:**

- Establish technical credibility through progressive demonstration
- Enter via SBIR pathway while developing dual-use applications
- Position as enhancement not replacement to existing systems
- Maintain focus on measurable performance advantages over marketing hype

**Key Differentiators:**

- **Speed**: <2ms latency vs 2-5 seconds for competitors
- **Autonomy**: Complete edge operation without communications
- **Accountability**: Blockchain-verified engagement records
- **Capability**: Defeats RF-silent autonomous drones others cannot detect

The combination of Level-0 autonomous operation with blockchain audit trails is
genuinely innovative if positioned correctly. Focus on operational advantages,
demonstrate progressive capabilities, and maintain technical credibility through
specific, measurable claims.

This approach positions Phoenix Rooivalk not just as another counter-drone
system, but as the foundational architecture for next-generation autonomous
defense.

## 15. Reviewer Landmine Responses

### **"Does ledger latency ever slow a shot?"**

**No.** Audit is off-path; actions commit locally, then hashes/metadata are
posted asynchronously to Fabric; real-time loops never wait for a block.

### **"Are you using consensus to decide to fire?"**

**No.** Level-0 decisions are locally authoritative; any BFT is for non-critical
synchronization and tolerates ≤1/3 faulty when used.

### **"How fast is coalition sharing really?"**

**On-site sharing** can be sub-second; **cross-organization XCM** is
seconds-class, for coordination/attestation, not fire-control.

### **"Why Fabric and not public chains?"**

Military-grade governance, private channels, identity-bound participants, proven
throughput (~3-3.5k TPS), and classification-aware segregation.

### **"Why mention Solana at all?"**

POC-only to harvest performance techniques in isolation with a hard budget/time
box; no production connectivity or data ever.
