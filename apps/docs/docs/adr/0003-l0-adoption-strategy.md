# ADR 0003: Level-0 Autonomous Architecture

Date: 2025-09-24 Status: Accepted

## Context

Blockchain protocols cannot achieve &lt;2ms authentication latency required for
real-time drone operations. Solana offers exceptional performance (65,000 TPS)
but suffers from reliability issues.

## Decision

Implement a Level-0 autonomous base layer that operates independently of
blockchain, with blockchain layers providing optimization and compliance rather
than critical functionality.

## Consequences

**Positive:**

- Meets &lt;2ms authentication requirement
- Enables use of high-performance but unreliable blockchains
- Provides offline operation capability
- Ensures mission continuity during blockchain failures

**Negative:**

- Increases implementation complexity
- Requires additional $2.5M investment
- Needs specialized engineering expertise
- Complex state synchronization

## Alternatives Considered

1. Pure blockchain solution - Rejected: Cannot meet latency requirements
2. Edge-only solution - Rejected: Lacks audit trail and compliance
3. Traditional centralized - Rejected: Single point of failure

## Implementation
