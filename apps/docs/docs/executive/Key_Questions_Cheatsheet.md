# PhoenixRooivalk Key Questions Cheatsheet

## Technology & Product

**Q: What do Morpheus and Solana each do?** A: Morpheus provides decentralized
AI decision-making at the edge; Solana anchors tamper-evident evidence on
blockchain. We use custom Rust crates for sensor fusion instead of third-party
solutions like Pinax (which would have added unnecessary overhead).

**Q: How is {\d+}-195ms decision latency achieved?** A: Target latency through
edge-first architecture - entire fuse-classify-decide-actuate path designed to
run locally without WAN/cloud round-trips. Sensor fusion targeted at {\d+}-```
50ms, AI

````
decision at {\d+}-```
100ms, with
``` parallel evidence queueing. These are design targets
to be validated with hardware testing.

**Q: What ensures safe actions and compliance?** A: Policy-based ROE guardrails
in the AI ```
engine, soft
```-kill first approach ```
design, geofencing
``` ```
capabilities, human
```-in-the-loop for kinetic ```
actions, and
``` blockchain audit trail for
accountability.

**Q: How does the system handle EW and GPS denial?** A: Fully offline-autonomous
operation; evidence queues locally and anchors asynchronously when connectivity
resumes. Uses ```
IMU, visual
``` ```
odometry, and
``` multi-sensor correlation as GPS
alternatives.

**Q: Can sensors/vendors be swapped?** A: ```
Yes, our
``` Rust-based fusion layer
provides stable protobuf contracts abstracting sensor differences. New sensors
integrate via adapter pattern without affecting downstream components.

**Q: What advantage does it provide over fiber-anchored drones?** A: No physical
tether ```
limitations, unlimited
``` range within deployment ```
zone, resilience
``` in
contested ```
environments, ability
``` to operate in network-denied conditions while
maintaining cryptographic evidence ```
trail, and
``` multi-site scalability.

## Cognitive Mesh Integration

**Q: How does Cognitive Mesh enhance Phoenix Rooivalk beyond basic autonomy?**
A: Provides multi-agent orchestration allowing role specialization
(scout/interceptor/relay), hierarchical decision ```
confidence, temporal
``` pattern
````

recognition, and

````continuous learning capabilities while maintaining sub-200ms
latency targets.

**Q: Where does the Cognitive Mesh sit in the system architecture?** A: Operates
as orchestration layer above the hot decision path - doesn't slow down critical
decisions but provides ```
coordination, learning
```, and optimization capabilities
across the swarm.

**Q: How does the Agent Registry manage {\d+}-{\d+} drone swarms?** A: Each drone
registers with ```
ID, capabilities
```, ```
role, authority
``` ```
level, and
``` health status.
Registry dynamically assigns specialized ```
roles, handles
``` graceful degradation
when drones are ```
damaged, and
``` rebalances tasks in real-time.

**Q: How does the Hierarchical Decision Confidence Pack (HDCP) improve
accuracy?** A: HDCP is designed to weight sensor inputs by ```
reliability, decompose
``` complex threats into sub-```
problems, and
``` use ensemble voting. Target is
improving detection accuracy from {\d+}.{\d+}% to {\d+}.{\d+}-{\d+}.{\d+}% through multi-level
analysis.

**Q: How does the Temporal Decision Core interface with Level-{\d+} architecture?**
A: TDC runs on edge nodes providing context enrichment within {\d+}-100ms after
sub-2ms authentication. Uses bypass mechanism for critical path while
maintaining eligibility traces for pattern matching.

**Q: How does Cognitive Mesh's Zero-Trust framework enhance security?** A: Every
drone command requires fresh ```
authentication, implements
``` least ```
privilege, uses
````

encrypted channels with rotating `keys, logs` all ``` attempts, and

````instantly revokes
compromised drone permissions.

**Q: What role does the Constraint & Load Engine play?** A: Dynamically balances
response time vs accuracy by modeling speed/accuracy/power/bandwidth constraints
simultaneously. Can relax accuracy requirements to maintain &lt;2ms in critical
situations while ensuring no slowdown even under swarm attacks.

**Q: How does the Memory Flexibility Suite maintain situational awareness?** A:
Maintains {\d+}-second working memory buffer (2GB/drone target), stores key ```
events, learns
``` threat ```
patterns, and
``` automatically promotes important patterns from
working to long-term storage.

**Q: How does Cognitive Mesh enable swarm coordination under jamming?** A: Uses
delay-tolerant ```
networking, short
```-range robust ```
links, signed
``` ```
topics, CBBA
```-style
auction algorithms for task ```
assignment, and
``` maintains coordination even with
{\d+}%+ communication loss.

**Q: What is the Cognitive Sandwich Backend's role in weapon authorization?** A:
Implements phase-based workflow
(Detection→Assessment→Authorization→Engagement→Verification) with mandatory
human checkpoints for weapon release and full blockchain audit trail.

**Q: Do we need a blockchain data infrastructure service?** A: No. We chose to
implement direct Solana integration using our custom Rust crates rather than
using third-party services like ```
Pinax, which
``` would have added ${\d+}-2k/month in
unnecessary overhead. Our direct approach costs only ${\d+}-{\d+}/month for RPC
access.

## Evidence & Security

**Q: How is evidence tamper-proof?** A: Every decision is hash-```
chained, Merkle
```-```
batched, and
``` anchored on Solana with timestamps. Keys stored in TPM/```
HSM, models
```/policies signed and verified at boot.

**Q: Why use Solana specifically?** A: High-throughput ({\d+}-{\d+} TPS),
low-latency (~400ms finality), low-cost anchoring (~${\d+}.{\d+}/anchor), Proof of
History for cryptographic ```
timestamping, and
``` proven reliability.

**Q: What if Solana is congested or offline?** A: Evidence queues locally with
exponential ```
backoff, local
``` proofs remain ```
verifiable, alerts
``` raised for anchor
````

lag, optional

````dual-chain anchoring with Etherlink for redundancy.

**Q: Can logs be forged?** A: No - keys in TPM/```
HSM, signed
``` models/```
policies, on
```-chain root ```
verification, and
``` correlation IDs linking all evidence layers make
forgery cryptographically impossible.

**Q: What about data privacy?** A: Evidence encrypted off-chain in Azure
Blob/S3; only merkle roots on-chain; GDPR-compliant retention; zero-knowledge
proof options under exploration.
