# Phoenix Rooivalk Team and Repository Status

## Project Status Overview

**Despite extensive searches across GitHub and LinkedIn, the Phoenix Rooivalk
project and associated team members appear to operate privately or are in
stealth mode.** The GitHub user "JustAGhosT" (Jurie Smit) has no publicly
accessible repository matching this project, and LinkedIn profiles for juriesmit
and martynrede could not be located. This suggests the project is either in
early development, operates under different identifiers, or maintains
operational security typical of defense technology initiatives.
