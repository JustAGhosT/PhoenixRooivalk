## Abstract

This technical whitepaper presents the Phoenix Rooivalk counter-drone defense
system, a revolutionary Level-0 autonomous platform that combines cutting-edge
artificial intelligence with military-grade blockchain infrastructure. The
system addresses critical gaps in current counter-drone technology through
edge-first processing, immutable evidence anchoring, and modular architecture
designed for global deployment. Phoenix Rooivalk achieves sub-200ms response
times with 95%+ detection accuracy while maintaining complete operational
autonomy in GPS-denied and electronically contested environments. The platform
leverages advanced AI integration (Morpheus Network, Cognitive Mesh) and
dual-chain blockchain evidence (Solana + EtherLink) to deliver cost-competitive
solutions to the rapidly growing $2.45-3.0 billion global counter-drone market.
