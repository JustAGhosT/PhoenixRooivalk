# 🚀 Launch Guide - ThreatSimulator Desktop

## ⚡ Quick Launch (30 seconds)

```bash
# From project root:
pnpm sim:dev

# ⏳ First build: 30-60 seconds (compiling WASM)
# ⚡ Subsequent builds: <2 seconds (incremental)

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Launch Issues

### Issue: "trunk: command not found"

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Trunk v0.21.14 is now installed

**If it happens again:**

```bash
cargo install trunk --locked
```

### Issue: "error taking the canonical path to the watch ignore path: target"

**Status**: ✅ FIXED - Trunk.toml updated

**What was fixed:**

- Removed `"target"` from `ignore` list in `Trunk.toml`
- Changed `address` to `addresses` (deprecated field)
- Set `open = true` for auto-browser launch

### Issue: "Connection refused" or "Still compiling..."

**Status**: ⏳ NORMAL - First WASM build takes 30-60 seconds

**What's happening:**

1. Trunk is compiling Rust → WASM
2. Optimizing the bundle
3. Setting up dev server
4. Will auto-open browser when ready

**Wait for:**

```
✅ Build success
✅ Serving on: http://127.0.0.1:8080
```

### Issue: "pnpm update available 9.6.0 → 10.18.1"

**Status**: ℹ️ INFORMATIONAL - Not critical

**To update (optional):**

```bash
npm install -g pnpm@latest
# or
corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
```

**Or ignore it** - The current version (9.6.0) works fine.

## 📊 What Happens on First Launch

### Step-by-Step Process:

```
1. pnpm sim:dev
   └─> Runs: pnpm -C apps/threat-simulator-desktop dev

2. npm script runs: trunk serve --open
   └─> Trunk starts...

3. Trunk compiles Rust → WASM
   ├─> Compiling 20+ crates
   ├─> Optimizing WASM
   ├─> Generating bindings
   └─> Creating dist/ folder
   ⏱️ Time: 30-60 seconds (first time)

4. Dev server starts
   └─> Listening on http://127.0.0.1:8080

5. Browser auto-opens
   └─> Game loads!

6. Incremental builds
   └─> Changes recompile in <2 seconds
```

## ⏱️ Expected Times

### First Build (Cold Start)

- **WASM Compilation**: 30-60 seconds
- **Server Start**: 2-3 seconds
- **Total**: ~40-65 seconds

### Incremental Builds (After Changes)

- **Recompile**: 1-2 seconds
- **Hot Reload**: Instant
- **Total**: ~2 seconds

### Production Build

- **Optimization**: 2-5 minutes

## 📞 Need Help?

- **First build slow?** → Normal! Compiling WASM takes time
- **Port in use?** → Change port in `Trunk.toml`
- **WASM errors?** → Run `pnpm sim:test` to check code
- **Still stuck?** → See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md)

**The app is fully functional - enjoy the game!** 🚀
