# Phoenix Rooivalk Threat Simulator - Desktop Application

A high-performance desktop application built with **Tauri** (Rust backend) and **Leptos** (Rust frontend/WASM) for simulating counter-drone defense scenarios with blockchain-based evidence recording.

## Architecture

### Stack
- **Backend**: Tauri 2.0 (Rust)
- **Frontend**: Leptos 0.6 (Rust + WebAssembly)
- **Build Tool**: Trunk
- **Game Engine**: Custom Rust implementation with web-sys
- **Physics**: Rapier2D (WASM-compatible)
- **Evidence**: Phoenix Evidence Crate (blockchain anchoring)

### Migration from React/Next.js

This application is a complete rewrite of the marketing website's ThreatSimulator component, migrating from:
- React + Next.js → Leptos (Rust WASM)
- JavaScript game logic → Pure Rust
- Web-only → Cross-platform desktop app (Tauri)

**Benefits**:
- **Performance**: 10-100x faster game loop and physics
- **Memory Safety**: Rust eliminates entire classes of bugs
- **Native Desktop**: Full OS integration, better performance
- **Smaller Binary**: ~10MB vs 100+MB Electron apps
- **Blockchain Integration**: Direct integration with evidence crate

## Prerequisites

### Required Tools
```bash
# Rust (1.70+)
curl --proto '=https' --tlsv1.2 -sSf https://sh.rustup.rs | sh

# Trunk (build tool for Leptos)
cargo install trunk

# Tauri CLI
cargo install tauri-cli --version "^2.0"

# wasm target
rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown
```

### Platform-Specific Dependencies

#### Linux
```bash
sudo apt update
sudo apt install libwebkit2gtk-4.1-dev \
  build-essential \
  curl \
  wget \
  file \
  libxdo-dev \
  libssl-dev \
  libayatana-appindicator3-dev \
  librsvg2-dev
```

#### macOS
```bash
xcode-select --install
```

#### Windows
- Install [Microsoft C++ Build Tools](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
- Install [WebView2](https://developer.microsoft.com/en-us/microsoft-edge/webview2/)

## Development

### 🏃 Quick Commands (From Project Root)

```bash
# Frontend only (fastest iteration, hot-reload)
pnpm sim:dev

# Full desktop app (with Tauri backend)
pnpm sim:dev:tauri

# Run all 35 tests
pnpm sim:test

# Lint and format
pnpm sim:lint
cargo fmt -p threat-simulator-desktop
```

### Running the App (From App Directory)

```bash
cd apps/threat-simulator-desktop

# Frontend only
pnpm dev          # or: trunk serve --open

# Full desktop app
pnpm dev:tauri    # or: cargo tauri dev
```

**📖 See [QUICKSTART.md](./QUICKSTART.md) for detailed setup and troubleshooting.**

This will:
1. Start the Trunk dev server (frontend)
2. Build the Tauri backend
3. Launch the desktop application

### Frontend-Only Development

```bash
cd apps/threat-simulator-desktop
trunk serve --open
```

Useful for rapid UI iteration without Tauri overhead.

### Building for Production

```bash
cd apps/threat-simulator-desktop
cargo tauri build
```

Outputs will be in `src-tauri/target/release/bundle/`.

## Game Mechanics

### Threat Types
- **Commercial**: Basic drone, low health, slow speed
- **Military**: Armored, higher health, moderate speed
- **Swarm**: Multiple coordinated units
- **Stealth**: Harder to detect and track
- **Kamikaze**: Fast, high damage on impact
- **Recon**: Intelligence gathering, evasive
- **Electronic Warfare**: Jams systems, reduces effectiveness

### Weapon Systems
See `src/game/types.rs` for the complete list of 13 weapon types including:
- Kinetic Interceptor
- Electronic Warfare
- Directed Energy Laser
- Net Capture
- High Power Microwave (HPM)
- RF Takeover
- And more...

### Resources
- **Energy**: Required for weapon firing
- **Cooling**: Prevents weapon overheating
- **Mothership Health**: Game over when depleted

## Evidence Recording

All game events are recorded and can be anchored to blockchain:
- Session start/end
- Threat neutralizations
- Weapon deployments
- Performance metrics
- Achievement unlocks

Integration with Phoenix Evidence crate provides tamper-evident audit trails for training and evaluation.

## Performance Targets

- **Target FPS**: 60+
- **Max Threats**: 200+
- **Max Drones**: 50+
- **Memory**: <100MB
- **Binary Size**: <15MB (compressed)

## Testing

```bash
# Run all tests
cargo test --workspace

# Run frontend tests
cd apps/threat-simulator-desktop
trunk test

# Run backend tests
cd src-tauri
cargo test
```

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Failed to bundle project"**
- Ensure all platform dependencies are installed
- Check Tauri logs in `src-tauri/target/`

**"WASM compilation failed"**
- Verify `wasm32-unknown-unknown` target is installed
- Check Trunk version compatibility

**"Can't find Tauri commands"**
- Rebuild backend: `cd src-tauri && cargo build`
- Check `tauri.conf.json` configuration

## Contributing

See the root `CONTRIBUTING.md` for general guidelines.

### Migration Checklist
When migrating React components to Leptos:
1. Convert state hooks (`useState`) to signals (`create_signal`)
2. Convert effects (`useEffect`) to Leptos effects (`create_effect`)
3. Convert refs (`useRef`) to node refs (`create_node_ref`)
4. Port TypeScript types to Rust structs
5. Replace JavaScript math with Rust implementations
6. Test thoroughly with `cargo test`
