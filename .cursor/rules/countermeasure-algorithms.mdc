# countermeasure-algorithms

No explicit countermeasure algorithms are documented in the provided source files. The ThreatSimulator.tsx component (Importance Score: 65/100) implements a high-level simulation of threat responses, but does not contain the core RF jamming or signal disruption logic.

Key observable elements:

1. Threat Response Framework
Location: apps/marketing/src/components/ThreatSimulator.tsx
- Models threat detection and neutralization simulation
- Implements defensive response calculations
- Coordinates autonomous defense actions

2. Evidence Recording for Countermeasures
Location: apps/api/src/main.rs
- Records countermeasure deployment events
- Maintains audit trail of signal disruption activities
- Tracks effectiveness of jamming operations

The specification suggests countermeasure capabilities exist but the actual signal disruption, RF jamming, and GPS spoofing algorithms are not present in the provided source files. This indicates these components may be:

- Implemented in separate, restricted modules
- Part of hardware-specific firmware
- Contained in classified documentation
- Managed through external systems
