# detection-systems

The detection system architecture consists of two primary components:

1. Multi-Sensor Threat Detection (apps/marketing/src/components/ThreatSimulator.tsx)
Importance Score: 90/100
- Real-time signature analysis for drone identification
- Integration of RF, acoustic, and optical sensor data streams
- Behavioral pattern matching against known drone profiles
- Autonomous classification of single drones vs swarm formations
- Detection confidence scoring based on sensor fusion results

2. Threat Assessment Engine (packages/types/src/index.ts)
Importance Score: 85/100
- Threat level classification matrix
- Multi-sensor data fusion model
- Detection confidence scoring algorithms
- Signal deconfliction for overlapping sensor zones

Core Detection Workflows:

1. Initial Signal Acquisition
- Parallel processing of RF, acoustic and optical signatures
- Cross-validation of signals across multiple sensor types
- Automated noise filtering and signal isolation

2. Threat Classification
- Pattern matching against known drone signatures
- Behavioral analysis for intent determination
- Real-time updates to threat assessment scores
- Swarm detection and formation analysis

3. Detection Response Integration
- Direct integration with countermeasure systems
- Automated handoff of tracking data
- Continuous threat status monitoring
- Detection zone management

The system emphasizes military-grade detection reliability with specialized handling of battlefield interference conditions and degraded sensor environments.
