Core Integration Components:

1. Evidence Chain Integration (Importance: 95/100)
`crates/evidence/src/lib.rs`
- Cross-chain evidence anchoring system
- Integrates Solana and EtherLink blockchains
- Standardized evidence format for military engagements
- Chain-specific transaction handlers

2. Keeper Service Integration (Importance: 85/100)
`apps/keeper/src/lib.rs`
- Coordinates evidence processing across chains
- Manages blockchain integration points
- Handles multi-network confirmation flows
- Implements military-grade audit trails

3. Address Validation Framework (Importance: 80/100)
`crates/address-validation/src/lib.rs`
- Cross-chain address validation system
- Network-specific format handlers
- Military compliance verification
- Chain metadata integration

4. Type System Integration (Importance: 75/100)
`packages/types/src/index.ts`
- Unified threat detection interfaces
- Cross-module data structures
- Evidence chain type definitions
- Integration point specifications

Integration Patterns:

1. Cross-Chain Evidence Flow
- Dual-network anchoring
- Standardized payload formats
- Military-specific verification
- Chain-agnostic interfaces

2. Service Coordination
- Evidence processing pipeline
- Multi-chain monitoring
- Defense-grade validation
- Audit compliance handlers

3. Module Communication
- Standardized type interfaces
- Cross-service protocols
- Military data formats
- Secure channel definitions
