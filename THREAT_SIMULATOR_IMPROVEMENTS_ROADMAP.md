## üöÄ Phase 1: Core Foundation (High Priority)
*Foundation elements for enhanced visual appeal and performance*

### Visual Effects
- [x] **Particle Systems**: Implement explosion effects when threats are neutralized
- [x] **Trail Effects**: Add visual trails showing threat movement paths
- [x] **Dynamic Lighting**: Implement realistic shadows and glows for threats

### Audio Integration
- [ ] **Sound Effects**: Add radar pings, weapon firing, and threat detection alerts
- [ ] **Background Ambience**: Implement military/defense base atmosphere
- [ ] **Audio Cues**: Different sounds for different threat types and weapon systems

### Game Mechanics
- [x] **Difficulty Scaling**: Progressive threat spawning with increasing spawn rates, speed, and health over time
- [x] **Dynamic Threat Behavior**: Add threat AI that makes threats more evasive as levels progress

### Performance Optimizations
- [x] **Object Pooling**: Reuse threat objects instead of creating/destroying
- [x] **Efficient Rendering**: Use CSS transforms instead of changing position properties
- [x] **Frame Rate Control**: Allow users to adjust simulation speed and frame rate
- [x] **Memory Management**: Improve cleanup of timeouts and event listeners
